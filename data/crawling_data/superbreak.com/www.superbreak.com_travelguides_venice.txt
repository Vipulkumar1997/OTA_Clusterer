Welcome to our Venice Guide




Full of handy hints and information, our Venice travel guide will help you plan a terrific short break in this incomparable Italian city. Fall in love with the fascinating history, the shopping and the cuisine, and discover what makes the city special – there’s nowhere quite like Venice.
Enjoy island-hopping and exploring Venice on its vast network of pretty waterways, or take to the streets and walk around the city’s highlights; new visitors to Venice invariably get lost – but it’s all part of the fun. Be sure to find the beautiful St Mark’s Basilica, impressive monuments and the great shopping at Piazza San Marco. The Rialto Bridge is also well worth seeing, as are the market and the trendy bars and restaurants in its vicinity. In the spring, the city is taken over by the spectacular Carnevale – the famous, annual masked ball makes for a unique experience if you’re lucky enough to be in Venice at the right time. For another extra-special experience, superb at any time of the year, try to catch a breath-taking Ballet or an outstanding Opera at the world-class Teatro La Fenice.
The romance capital of Southern Europe, Venice’s dreamy architecture and serene gondola rides are the stuff of legend – it’s the perfect city in which to make unforgettable memories. Round off your short stay in Venice at a gorgeous canal-side trattoria, listening to the strains of the city’s endless street music and soaking up the history and the ambience that makes it such a
magical holiday destination
.







Must do's by day




Visit the gorgeous St Mark’s Basilica and see the famous gilded bronze horses





Visit Rialto Market or Piazza San Marco for some retail therapy





Soak up the sunshine and enjoy some gelato at Piazza San Marco






Must do's by night




A must at any time of day, but more romantic by night, take a gondola ride





Find a Trattoria near the Rialto Bridge for a canal-side dinner





Catch a magical Opera or Ballet at the Teatro La Fenice










Travelling to Venice



Travelling to Venice



In all likelihood you’ll be flying into Venice – a mere 2 hours from London direct flying time; it’s incredibly easy to catch a connecting bus into the centre, with regular shuttles from both main airports.




By Rail



Be sure to get tickets to Venezia Santa Lucia for the main train station out on the lagoon; Venezia Mestre is the last stop on the mainland side




By Road



There are no roads in Venice, but if you fancy driving there anyway, park up at Europe’s largest Car Park at Tronchetto and ferry over to the city’s centre




By Air



Regular flights from London to Venice are operated by several airlines – being a popular destination, flights are also available around the UK, including from Manchester, Birmingham, Southend, Leeds & Bristol.






Getting Around in Venice



Getting around Venice



Exploring the magical waterways of Venice is sure to be the highlight of any trip to the city – take a gondola on special evenings, and get about on the handy water taxis and on foot the rest of the time




By Water Bus



Vaporetti, or water buses, are perhaps the most convenient way to get around, and much cheaper than lots of individual water taxi rides.




By Gondola



Naturally the most romantic way to get around Venice, gondola rides are a must – practically though, there are better ways to get from A to B.




On Foot



Venice isn’t an especially large city – you can certainly get around easily on foot, take a walking tour of the main sights in just a couple of hours.

Our Favourite Hotel of the Week!










Ca dei Conti



Absolutely dripping with traditional Venetian charm, the Ca dei Conti Hotel is just about as authentic as it gets. Beautifully decorated in bright, welcoming colours, the comfortable décor of the hotel’s accommodation makes it a perfect retreat in the busy city. Centrally located for the must-see attractions in Venice, the Ca dei Conti is a true gem



Find out more about the Ca dei Conti












Getting There Introduction

Naturally enough, the easiest way to get to Venice from the UK is by
flying into one of Venice’s two main airports
– Venice Marco Polo Airport or Treviso Airport. Venice Marco Polo Airport is a mere four miles from Venice, whilst Treviso is around 12 miles outside the city – transfers from both airports to Venice’s most popular spots run throughout the day.







By Air
Flights from several London airports are available daily, and given that Venice is such a popular destination, regular flights are also available from airports around the country. Airports with links to Venice include; Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds-Bradford, Newcastle, Bristol and Edinburgh.









Getting Around Introduction

A highly romantic special treat, no trip to Venice is complete without a gondola ride. Unless you’re especially fantastic at negotiating prices with the gondoliers however, getting around Venice by gondola alone would cost a small fortune. A cheaper and much quicker way to explore the waterways is on the Vaporetto, or water buses, and getting lost exploring Venice on foot is as much a rites of passage here as any gondola ride.







By Vaporetto
The Vaporetto are easily the most cost-efficient way to get around the city and between the islands – a two day unlimited pass costs around €30, single journeys usually around €7. The most useful routes – numbers 1 & 2 – take you down the must-see Grand Canal.





By Foot
The city isn’t all that big – you can walk from one side of the city to the other in just a few hours. The main paths are handily signposted for the main attractions, but you’ll almost certainly get lost at some point – be sure to have a map handy and your best pidgin Italian!





By Gondola
More of an experience than an actual mode of transport, try to negotiate a price with the Gondolier and agree on a figure before you set off – expect to pay anything from €80 upwards.









Shopping Introduction

Venice is renowned for being romantic, but it’s also supremely cultured, sophisticated and thoroughly charming – not least when it comes to its shopping. Being in Italy, you’re never too far from one of the major Fashion Houses, but the real charm of Venice is in its unique trades – the beautiful furnishings, the distinctive Murano Glassware and the famous Venetian Carnevale masks are all worth seeking out. No trip to Venice is complete without a visit to the famous Rialto Market, and Venice’s plethora of cavern-like antique stores and bookshops are ideal for finding unusual gifts and souvenirs.




Don’t Miss…

Il Baule Blu, 2916/AS Polo, Venice, Italy


Full of charm and quirky treasures, this little curiosity shop is full of antique toys, vintage clothes and odd bits of bric-a-brac. This very sweet store is perfect for a good value gift.

When you’re out and about sightseeing, be sure to make a few pit stops for a Panini or some Gelato. There are some wonderful bars and eateries near the popular Rialto Bridge, but if you’re looking to get away from anywhere overly touristy, be sure to stray into the backstreets and seek out one of our recommended restaurants.
