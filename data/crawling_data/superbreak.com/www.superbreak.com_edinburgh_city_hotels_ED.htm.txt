Edinburgh City, Edinburgh








Book a
hotel in Edinburgh
and enjoy the historical capital of Scotland and its impressive and endlessly pretty castle skyline. Edinburgh offers fantastic galleries and museums, world-class theatres and great shopping, making this destination vibrant and modern with a traditional Scottish twist.
Hotels in Edinburgh are scattered all around the city, with the main concentration being in the city centre, around Princes Street and the Royal Mile. It doesn't really matter, however, as the city is well connected with an excellent bus and tram network. In most cases, the best parts of Edinburgh are with walking distance of your hotel.
As a capital city, Edinburgh offers all of the regular delights you would expect - including excellent shopping and a nightlife that is famous all over the world - yet it has so much more to offer.

The Royal Mile
is the cultural heart of Edinburgh. In August this street is filled with artists and acts performing and selling tickets to their shows in the Edinburgh fringe. For the rest of the year, the Royal Mile offers excellent architecture, museums,
The Whiskey Experience
and a whole host of bars, tourist shops and restaurants. At the top of the Royal Mile, you reach Edinburgh Castle

Edinburgh Castle
sits atop a large hill right in the centre of Edinburgh. From here you can get some of the best views of the city, you could even see your hotel!

The Palace of Holyroodhouse
offers you a chance to see into how the royals live, with it still very much being one of the Queens residences. You can purchase tickets to
visit the Palace
from us when you book your Edinburgh Hotel

There is so much to see and do in this thriving city. To help plan your break, we have pulled together an
Edinburgh Travel Guide
that should help you decide what to do whilst there. What's more, if you want to make your most out of your short break, why not save some time and hop on one of our
flight packages to Edinburgh
So why not book your Hotel in Edinburgh and discover all the exciting things we've mentioned here.
