I have lived in the North West of England for the majority of my life and when my kids were young we visited Chester Zoo every year.  After several years we went back this year.  Despite now being a cynical old so and so, the zoo still retains its magic from when I was a kid and the joy I got when my kids eyes lit up seeing all the animals and not just the obvious ones like chimps and lions.  You need a good full day to see everything and it is a lot of walking but well worth it.  Although captive the animals are kept in decent sized and well designed enclosures and the zoo is dedicated to the protection of endangered species.
The staff were all friendly helpful and informative and now I am retired I will visit the zoo more regularly.
This has to be one of the best attractions in the North West of England if not the whole of the UK.  If you are in the area you should consider a visit.

This was my first Lantern Walk but not my first Wild Rumpus event so I had some idea what to expect i.e. actors engaging with the story, a steampunk/vintage/hipster aesthetic (which we love) and a task for the children to compete.
We got all these and there were lots of elements we all loved: The story idea of taking messages from the animals to Father Christmas.
The interaction between the 'animals' and the visitors (the flamingoes and gibbons were our favourites but kudos to the macaw dancing in spangly tights in -1 degree temperature).
The little lanterns and gingerbread the children got to take home were a nice thought.
The friendly staff and actors on what was a very cold night.

However: There were only a handful of big animal lanterns and they tended to be clumped together in the same area which caused bottlenecks with people trying to take photos.
The lanterns didn't really fit in with the rest of the event- it felt like there were two taking place at the same time that had become mixed up.
Nothing really came of taking the messages - one of our party pointed out they spent their time remembering the lists but weren't even asked at the end.  However, the kids were more interested in peering into the Komodo dragon enclosure than chatting to Father Christmas (who was lovely) so maybe he decided to let them off.
The length of the trail- we had to slow the kids down otherwise we'd have been round in 30 minutes because we weren't on a particularly crowded night.
The cost- £17.50 for adults and £15 for kids was very steep for the time it took and what was on view.  To contrast, last year we went to the Leeds Chinese Lantern Festival which was £14 for adults ans £12 for kids and took around 90 minutes with a lot more to see and much more variety.
We went on the very snowy Saturday evening and from what I had seen on social media lots of people were postponing their visits so the crowds weren't too bad (though there were still lots of times it was difficult to get a good view of the lanterns and actors) so we were lucky. If it had been at full capacity I think it would have been pretty unpleasant and frustrating.

I don't think it benefitted from being in the zoo because there were no animals in sight (don't blame them for staying in bed) which we had warned the children about beforehand.  If it had been in a park and I had paid £10/£12 a head to do it I would have been giving it 5 stars and praising it, however I found myself wishing I had gone back to Leeds and spent the difference on hot chocolate and donuts.

Just got home from Chester Zoo Christmas lantern parade with sons,daughter and grandchildren, what a disappointment. This was our third visit and expected it to be better or same as last year. But no. First of all the walk to actually see  something lit up was long and uninspiring especially for under fives who could see only two high fences. 
Almost no interaction between exhibits and children and over so quickly. The food hall was like a free for all! They have definitely got it wrong this year and we feel well and truly fleeced. Shame because it was lovely last year.
