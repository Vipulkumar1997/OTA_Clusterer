Rides were all good, no problems there...paying £7 to jump a two hr queue just to be in a half hr queue though?, broken cider bottles and used condoms littering the entrance?, travelling folk jumping queue’s and intimidating visitors/workers/security ?, poor management and totally demoralised looking staff( I don’t blame them!) Such a shame as they obviously have some of the best rollercoasters in the country. Just such a pity it’s so badly run. Wont be visiting again, not a great place for families...or anyone who takes exception at being ripped off.

Thorpe Park review

We visited Thorpe Park for an overnight stay on the 8th October 2017. After we booked our tickets, we realised that on the date we were going, it was fright night which meant we had access to the scare mazes and attractions. 

The Park-
We queued around 1 hour 20 minutes for The Big Top scare maze, which was quite enjoyable, and we would have got fast track tickets but the queue for fast track was about an hour so we didn’t bother. The theming of the scare maze itself was good, and very scary. I did find though that it was based around a circus, and the characters inside didn’t really relate to a circus. I saw one clown and man with a chainsaw. 

We also did the Platform 13 scare maze and we only waited around 15 minutes. I didn’t think the theming of this maze was good at all. They told a story at the start however I don’t think it related to the attraction. Basically, it was just people jumping out at you and that was it and so I was definitely disappointed with this one. 

Overall, the scare mazes were good, however they were pitch black and I couldn’t see where I was going most of the time and banged my head twice. I understand they are meant to be scary but 
As for our experience around the whole park, the most we waited for a ride was 45 minutes, which was pretty good considering how busy it was. We also noticed lots of safety improvements since the Alton Towers Smiler crash, and you could see that the staff were working hard to make sure that the guests were safe. We found that the man working on the Colossus queue, (think his name was Nathaniel), was very miserable and was yawning which I found ruined the queuing experience. 

Sometimes the music in certain areas was too intense and loud. We sat down for a drink and couldn’t hear each other because of the music. We were also disappointed that there were no actors walking around the park, as it said on the website that they would be. 

We found that a number of rides were not open, including one which I was desperate to do, I’m A Celebrity. This was really frustrating as it didn’t say on the website that there were over 6 rides closed. 

We went on Saw, and as you come round the corner in the carriage, you see a puppet of Saw on a bike and he is speaking, however you can’t hear a word he says because it’s so noisy. 

We found that there were lots of toilet facilities around the park, and we were never more than a 2 minute walk away from the toilets. The ride entrances could definitely be made much bigger and clearer, as we had trouble finding some of them. 
Humming extractor fan won't turn off. 

Thorpe Shark Hotel-

The location of this hotel is perfect as it is just inside the resort. Check in was a fast and considerably easy process. As we got into the room, we found that the room was absolutely tiny and there was no space to move. (There was only two of us, and we couldn’t move so I can’t imagine how a family of four would have got on as there is simply no space). The extractor fan hummed very loudly, and this went on all night as there was no option to switch it off. Parts of the room were also dirty, with hairs on the floor and dirt on the walls. Because the rooms are technically ‘shipping crates’, we woke up to a soaking wet door and bathroom mirror due to condensation. There was also only one window, which was a small circle around 10cm wide which makes you feel a bit trapped. The only other thing is the fact that the park is so close to the airport that sometimes you hear the planes fly past, and that was quite noisy and frequent. Overall, our stay in the hotel was good, however if I was to go back to the park, I would find a local Premier Inn instead. 

Food-
We found that the hot drinks machine was broke at the BBQ restaurant by Burger King and I’m A Celebrity which was a nightmare. As for Fin’s Bar and Grill, the food was lovely, however one meal had to be sent back due to missing items of food which were stated on the menu. They also didn’t have certain drinks that were on the menu which was quite disappointing. 

Overall, I’d give our visit to the  Thorpe Park Resort a 4/5! We were satisfied with the price we paid for our two days tickets, hotel stay and breakfast, and enjoyed our break away.

Some thrilling rides but the places comes across more like a fairground than theme park. We enjoyed saw and stealth. Food was overpriced and luke warm. Lots of litter in the que lines. If you don't buy fast pass you wont enjoy your day. Ghost train was very overhyped and had no clue what was going on. VR just does not work in a theme park. Been there done it but would not do it again.

I love coming to Thorpe Park. It’s always a fun day out for all the family. The lines can be long and it can be frustrating. You have to get there at opening to make the most of the day. Food works out to be expensive so it’s worth taking a picnic like many of the people I see there. There are lockers located around the theme park. All rides are really fun and enjoyable. Waiting times are clearly listed on screens throughout the park. Purchasing fast track tickets can be worth it to save time.
