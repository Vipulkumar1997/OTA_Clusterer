Midweek Break Inspiration from the Blog











Why Are Midweek Breaks Oh-So Good?

Stop chasing those two-day weekends and wake up and smell the midweek coffee. Check out our top reasons why a midweek break can sometimes be a relaxing and cheaper alternative.








5* Hotels That Won’t Break The Bank

Everyone loves a bargain, right? So if you want to spoil your partner or your friends (but not too much!), take a look at these luxurious 5* hotels, perfect for travellers on a budget.









Midweek Break Top Tip














Stressed out? Sounds like you need a relaxing midweek break to recuperate. Plan an indulgent spa break with friends or take your family somewhere new. Always wanted to explore a certain city? Now’s your chance! Midweek breaks are often cheaper due to increased availability, meaning you can save your pennies for attractions during your stay. What’s more, attractions that are jam-packed during the weekend are usually less busy midweek, so be sure to get your camera out and enjoy a selfie in peace!
