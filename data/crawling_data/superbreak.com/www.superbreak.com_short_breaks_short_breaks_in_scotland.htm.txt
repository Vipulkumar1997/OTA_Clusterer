Short Breaks in Scotland

Our hotel breaks in Scotland can see you enjoying the top attractions in Edinburgh, experiencing the fab shopping and fine dining of Glasgow, or sightseeing in distinctive Aberdeen. Our city breaks north of the border are a particularly popular way to discover all that Scotland can offer; no trip is complete without a whiskey tasting at a local distillery, or getting acquainted with the infamous nightlife. If you’re looking to get away from it all on our hotel breaks Scotland isn’t limited to its fantastic cities; the Highlands and Isles are perfect for a rural retreat. Loch Lomond is always a great choice, within easy driving distance of our hotels in Glasgow, but to really escape the city check out Aviemore, Pitlochry and Oban in the furthest northern reaches of Scotland.
