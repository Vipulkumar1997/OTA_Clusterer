Continue exploring your way through the sea of famous faces and come face-to-face with an eighteen-foot animatronic Kong head in the Kong: Skull Island experience alongside the famous Tom Hiddleston. There’s even time to learn about the history of Marie Tussaud herself, before sitting back and enjoying a ride through 400 years of London’s history in the iconic Spirit of London taxi ride. There’s also an exclusive Marvel Superheroes 4D adventure as well as a Star Wars experience, where you can discover a galaxy of your favourite characters and locations.

I went with my cousin to the museum. I have to say it was quite nice. I feel it even more modern compared to the Musée Grévin in Paris that I have done few years ago. It seems that Madame Tussauds has renewed a lot of things compared to 3 years ago. I would advice you to buy tickets in advance on internet to avoid to wait as the place is quite touristic...

I went here using a merlin premium pass. So I just went to the gate and within 5 minutes was in the lift going into the attraction. Worth spending more on a fast track ticket to beat the queues and if you have young kids who will get fed up standing outside. It can get really crowded inside and you’re always dodging people talking selfies and pics but it’s apart of the fun. You can see how the statues are made and even have your own hands modelled. The 4d show as really amazing. Some kids might get scared by the moving seats, smoke and 3D images, but generally it’s a great enjoyable show. I really liked the cab ride at the end and so did my son. It’s a great day out for all the family.

It was great, but I felt, and still feel, that they should have more celebrity wax figures as the Madame Tussauds in New York and LA have more diverse wax figures than the one in London. 

Also, they should make it more spacious so you can easily walk past without squeezing past people. 

I feel offended that they have Hitler's wax figure there. Just why?

The taxi ride was fun, but I'm not sure if they still have that there. If it is there, definitely go and try it!

I will only return here again if it is worth visiting, i.e. if more wax figures, which are of interest to me, come here.
