Getting to Manchester

Manchester is one of the UK’s busiest cities for business as well as visitor attractions, so great transport links allow people to travel to the city with ease and efficiency. With one of the largest UK airports, visitors flying into Manchester can begin their holiday as soon as they take off and when you land, trains and taxis will be waiting to take you directly to the centre of the city. Excellent motorway links connect the city to roads leading in every direction across the country, and frequent and efficient rail links can get you to or from London in just over 2 hours.




Top 3 Travel Tips


Book your train tickets in advance to save as much money as possible

Make sure you set off early as queues on the motorway can get bad at peak times

If you're flying, make sure you plan your connecting transport to your hotel for when you land, although taxi's will be waiting outside if you need one









By Rail
There are four main railway stations located in or around the centre of Manchester. Deansgate, Piccadilly, Oxford Road and Victoria are all busy stations, with Piccadilly transporting the majority of visitors. Virgin trains run services throughout the UK and can bring or take visitors to London in a little over two hours. TransPennine Express operates services North of Manchester to destinations such as Newcastle and Edinburgh. For shorter journeys, Northern Rail trains transport travellers around to the more nearby cities around the North.





By Road
Manchester is well connected to the rest of the UK by excellent motorway links. The M6 in both north and south directions is the busiest motorway in the UK, and can bring visitors from Scotland and most cities in the Midlands. The M62 Eastbound is the main motorway with links over the Pennines to Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. National Express run coaches to Manchester from all major UK cities, so if you don’t fancy driving that’s a great option. Cheaper too!





By Air

Manchester Airport is the only ‘Global gateway’ to Northern England. One of the busiest airports in the UK, Manchester Airport is used by more than 100 airlines, connecting 22 million passengers to more destinations in the world that any other airport in the country. Flying to 190 destinations, visitors come and go from all over the world, making it really easy if you’re coming to the city from abroad. Trains run from the airport to the city centre train stations every ten minutes, and a large tai rank waits outside for passengers not wishing to take the train.










Getting Around Manchester

The city centre is very much in walking distance, although you can also hop on and off the free city shuttle buses that nip around connecting the 4 main railway stations and bus terminals. Trams traverse the city too, and passes known as 'daysavers' are available for all the principal forms of transport from £4. Free maps can be gained from tourist information centres at Piccadilly Train Station and the Town Hall Annex. Hotels will often have copies available too. The main attractions are all signposted really well so planning your trip around the sights is easy. Just pick up an all day ticket or hire a bike and head out exploring the best that Manchester has to offer.

If you’re flying, make sure you plan your connecting transport to your hotel for when you land, although taxi’s will be waiting outside if you need one









By Bus
When in the city centre, you can hop on one of the Metroshuttle buses. These are free and link to all the main rail stations, shopping districts and businesses in the city centre and operate from 7am - 7pm Monday to Saturday, running approximately every 10 minutes. The Metroshuttle can take you from car parks, stations and tram stops around the city centre's main attractions so you can visit as many places as you have time for, without paying for travel.





By Taxi
Manchester's Metrolink tram system has been developed to encourage easier and faster travel in the city centre and beyond. Connecting all major railway stations and tourist attractions, the Metrolink runs every five minutes, making it the perfect mode of transport for those who don't require a strict timetable. Trams run from the early morning until late in the evening, and you purchase your ticket from the machine at the platform before you board. Be ready though as some ticket machines don’t accept card payment.





By Bike
Manchester is a bike-friendly city with many marked cycle lanes and dedicated routes throughout the city centre and beyond. With most of the main attractions and venues being around the city centre, cycling is a great way to avoid the main traffic and discover the city at your own pace. You don’t even have to take your own bike as there are numerous bike hire points around the city. The one inside Piccadilly Station is the most popular due to its convenient location.
