If you are a Man Utd fan, nuff said. If you are not, come and be overawed by the magnificent theatre of dreams. Take the stadium tour and museum, then you will be able to understand why this is no doubt the biggest football club in the world.

One of the must sees in Manchester is without doubt the Old Trafford Football Stadium - steeped in a wonderful history of success upon success it is a wonderful experience for everyone. Home to Manchester United football club, a tour of Old Trafford brings back excellent memories from the 90’s for me. It was a phenomenal experience and driving down Sir Matt Busby way down to the stadium was just awesome. The building is state of the art and the pitch is with class. Highly recommended.

I only went to the shop and then to the The Red Cafe . All the staff we met were very friendly especially the security personnel. I got what I wanted in the shop . I had a nice light lunch in the cafe and the food was excellent. Even though there was no match on there was a nice buzz about the place; you felt you were somewhere very special.

A really informative and properly administered stadium tour.  The tour leader explained each and every detail and also provided some time for questions to be asked - questions which he gladly answered.  One gets to sit in various parts of the stadium.  Additionally, one also gets to visit the players' tunnel and the teams' dressing rooms.  Really interesting!
