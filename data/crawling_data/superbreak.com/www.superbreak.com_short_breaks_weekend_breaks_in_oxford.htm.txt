The iconic blue building is a Grade II listed building was first established in 1391, and has been a coffee shop, an inn, a hotel and a grocery store before setting up as The Grand Cafe in the mid 1990s. The Grand Cafe is well known for its delicious food enjoyed in a decadent setting, and is particularly popular for its tasty afternoon tea.
