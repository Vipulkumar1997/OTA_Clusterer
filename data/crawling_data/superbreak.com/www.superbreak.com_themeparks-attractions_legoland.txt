Took my son for his third birthday, had an absolutely great day though it was very busy! Shops and restaurants pricey but food in the pasta and pizza buffet was good! Long queues for the rides but son had a great time. Only given 4/5 because of ticket prices and paying for parking on top!

We visited on the last 2 days of the Summer season and it was clear to see the resort was closing down for the season - very few concessions open (over an hour to get ripped off for 4 hot dogs and a coffee).  Lots of rides and attractions closed and others were breaking down on fairly regular basis.

We expected long(ish) queues but had expected lego to be around for the kids to play with - nothing (guess it kept being stolen previously)

Won't return

We visited back in August this year and thought that given the cost of it the place would be in a much better condition than it was.

The Lego models in the model town are old, tired and dirty. Some of the moving models don't even work and it looks like its just left to fend for itself.

The star wars exhibit is worth a visit and is well maintained.

Getting around can be a bit hard even with the map as the signs don't quite point the ways they should do.

The rides have really long waiting times and are geared towards the Q-Bot which is very expensive when your there with 3 kids under 5.

Probably wont return as its not value for money.

Been here a few times with my son and he loves it. The rides are all fun for young and old and the waiting lines are not too long so you can do all the rides in one day. There is a selection of places to eat and several live shows throughout the day. I enjoyed the mini model village they have as well. Ideal for young families.

We had a great day out the kids loved it very little queueing for the rides. We booked a 5pm slot to see father Christmas we got to the park at 10am and because I didn't print the tickets I had an hour queue for guests services to print off a bar code for them to scan. So PRINT YOUR TICKETS BEFORE YOU GO. We joined a massive queue for father Christmas at 4.30 thinking that we might get to our time slot only to be removed from the queue and told to come back at 5pm as the queue should have gone down by then as they have had problems! We rejoined the queue at 5pm it was longer than it was at 4.30. Nobody was told the waiting time it was freezing cold the kids really were miserable we got in at 6.30pm I found this unacceptable so did a lot of customers. We got handed out a 50p bar of chocolate. It would have been better if they handed out tea and coffee. On an upside the walk to santa was amazing.
