FAQs


Need more info about Flight + Hotel packages?



Read our FAQs









What documentation will I receive?

You will receive your booking documentation by email as a PDF attachment which will include confirmation for your flights and accommodation and an ATOL certificate. We do not issue flight tickets; your confirmation acts as your e-ticket which you should print out and take to the airport to provide at the check-in desk.






Can I cancel/amend my booking once confirmed?

In most cases you can amend your booking by calling us, but charges will apply and you may incur additional costs if you are amending your flight and the fare has increased since your original booking. If you cancel your booking a 100% cancellation charge will apply, therefore we recommend you take out adequate travel insurance. You can also add this to your package at time of booking with us.






Can I book my seats on my flight?

Your seats will be allocated at check in and we do not pre-allocate seat numbers.






Is my booking protected by ATOL?

Yes, your booking is fully protected by ATOL and our number is
10518
. An ATOL certificate will be issued with your booking confirmation.






Can I add flight extras to my booking?

We cannot currently add any extras to your booking. However, you can purchase various extras including priority boarding, if available, at the airport when you check in.






Is the transfer between the airport and my accommodation included?

A transfer it not included in your package from/to the airport and the resort you are staying in and cannot be added via our website. However, if you would like to add a transfer please contact our call centre on 01904 717 362 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras) who will be able to add this to your booking.






Do I need travel insurance?

Travel Insurance is strongly recommended and you can buy this from us at the time of booking.






Can I book connecting flights or a one way flight?

No, we only sell point to point, direct return flights.






Are in-flight meals included?

Meals are not included and we cannot add them to your package. Some airlines may include light meals, drinks or snacks for all passengers e.g. British Airways – otherwise you can purchase drinks and snacks on board the aircraft.






Is hold baggage included?

Yes, hold baggage (checked-in baggage) is included and this is confirmed on your documentation. One bag is included per passenger (excluding infants that are under 2 years).






What is my hold baggage allowance?

Your hold baggage (checked-in baggage) allowance can vary between airlines. This will be confirmed to you at the time of booking and will also appear on your documentation.






What is my cabin baggage allowance?

Your cabin baggage allowance can vary between airlines. This will be confirmed to you at the time of booking and will also appear on your documentation.






What are the restrictions on carrying liquids in my hand luggage?

There are restrictions on the amount of liquids you can take in your hand luggage. Where possible, pack liquids in your hold baggage (checked-in baggage). We recommend you check the latest regulations before you fly on the Civil Aviation Authority website (
www.caa.co.uk
).






Do I have to check in online?

No, airport check in is included in your package, so you do not need to check in online.






What time do I need to check in for my flight?

The check in time will be on your documentation however we suggest you arrive at the airport two hours before a short haul flight and three hours before a long haul flight. If you require further information please refer to the airline's website.






Which terminal do I fly from?

Your departure airport may have more than one terminal. Please check your flight number on the airport's own website within a week of departure for the latest information as the terminal for your flight may change from that specified on your confirmation email.






What happens if I miss my flight?

If you miss your flight you will have to purchase a new flight ticket. Sometimes it may be possible for the airline to transfer you onto the next available flight but this is never guaranteed. Depending on the circumstances under which you missed your flight you would need to check with your insurance provider whether they would cover any additional charges you may incur.






What is Advanced Passenger Information (API)?

This is the information collected by the airline before travel and includes passport number, expiry date, place of issue and your date of birth. If required this will be collected by the airline at the airport when checking in.






Can I book assistance at the airport?

Once you have made your booking please contact us and we will arrange for assistance at the departure and arrival airports. This is normally free of charge.






Do I require a passport for International travel?

Yes, a valid passport is required for travel - British Citizens must hold a valid 10-year passport. Please note that certain destinations insist on at least 6 months validity from the return date. UK Citizens can check out the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for passport, visa and health information, at
www.gov.uk/knowbeforeyougo
. Other nationalities should check with their own governments. It is also your responsibility to check whether you need a visa to enter your destination country.






What sort of photo ID do I require for when flying within the UK or to the Channel Islands/Irish Republic from the UK?

We recommend you travel with a valid passport, but other forms of valid photographic ID such as Citizen card, Photographic driving license, Student Card, Forces ID card, Airport/Airline Employees Security ID Pass, Police Warrant Card/Badge, UK Council issued bus pass (Senior Citizens only) will be accepted by most airlines.






Can I fly when pregnant?

Airline policies vary, please contact our call centre on 01904 717 362 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras) before booking.






What is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)?

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is when muscles are constricted and the return of blood from the legs to the heart is inhibited. This can lead to fluid collecting in the feet and to subsequent muscular aches and pains, a feeling of excess fatigue or very rarely, more serious complications even after your flight has ended.






How can I reduce the risk of developing DVT?

The best advice is to avoid being totally static throughout your flight this includes night flights.

The steps below may help to reduce your risk:


Drink plenty of water during the flight and avoid alcohol and caffeine during the flight (and before)

Take only short periods of sleep & do not take sleeping pills

Try not to cross your legs whilst seated

Walk around the cabin whenever you can

Carry out the simple in-flight exercises provided by your airline

Wear loose fitting comfortable clothes and shoes when travelling





Prices shown above will vary depending on the departure date, time of booking and departure airport you choose and are for guidance only. For exact prices to match your requirements please search online or contact our call centre. Prices are per person and include accommodation for the number of nights stated, return flights, taxes and a hold luggage allowance per person. All flight inclusive breaks on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. The ATOL protection does not apply to all holidays and travel services shown on this website.
