Morocco is situated in North Africa and is famed for its long northern coastline, striking Atlas Mountains, southern Sahara Desert, traditional cuisine and mint tea. Visit the colourful capital Marrakech with its lively Souks (markets), striking Koutoubia Mosque and 16th Century Saadian Tombs.
Most flights from the UK will arrive into Marrakesh Menara Airport, add an airport taxi transfer onto your booking for an easy start to your break and a quick journey to
your Marrakech hotel.

Marrakech
is one of Morocco?s largest cities and a major tourist destination. Known as the "Red City" its highlights include world famous square, Jemaa el-Fnaa, traditional Souk markets and impressive city walls, gates and ramparts. Cultural sites include the Museum of Islamic Art, Ben Youssef Mosque and the Museum of Moroccan Arts. Make sure you try delicious local cuisine such as tanjia marrakshia and green tea with mint.

Agadir
is located on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. Famous for its beaches which are great for surfing as well as relaxing and soaking up the sun. Other highlights of Agadir include the Valley of the Birds, the marina with its Moorish architecture and Souk El Had, one of the largest markets in Morocco.

Ouarzazate
is a city on the edge of the Sarah desert which is most famous as a location for films and TV programmes. Such films as Lawrence of Arabia, The Living Daylights and epic TV series Game of Thrones have been shot here over the years. Ait Benhaddou outside the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its red clay buildings. Add an Ouarzazate - 1 Day Tour to your Superbreak booking.
Morocco is a historic and traditional country but is re-inventing itself as a modern and vibrant destination for the 21st century. From mountains to deserts to beaches, there is something to suit all tastes.

Hotels in Morocco





Agadir

Agadir, situated on the southern part of Morocco's Atlantic coastline, enjoys over 340 days of sunshine a year and is a modern resort. An earthquake destroyed much of the old town in 1960 but life around the harbour continues as it has always done and the views from the 16th Century Kasbah are breathtaking.

Casablanca

Casablanca is Morocco's modern metropolis but with a rich heritage of art deco architecture fused with North African elements as a tangible reminder of its French colonial past. Fez is a maze of stone, marble and plaster surrounded by orchards. As the spiritual centre of Morocco, the old town lives in the shadow of the minarets.
