Getting There

As one of The UK’s major cities, Edinburgh has
many travel options for visitors in the city
. Edinburgh Airport is the busiest in the whole of Scotland, flying to and from destinations all around the world. The airport also offers connecting flights to all UK airports. Travelling to Edinburgh by car is easy thanks to an extensive motorway system and well signposted tourist highlights. Arriving in the city by train is probably the easiest option, as regular service run from numerous stations in The UK and the East Coast line is the fastest intercity route in The UK.




Top 3 Travel Tips


When driving, time your journey to avoid rush hour periods of 7.30am to 9.30am and 4.30pm to 6.30pm Monday to Friday

If you’re heading to Edinburgh for the theatre, Haymarket Train Station is the most convenient

If you’re flying, the Lothian Buses Airlink service 100 can take/ bring you to the airport for around £3 each way









By Rail

There are two main railway stations with close access to the city centre. Both Edinburgh Waverley and Edinburgh Haymarket Stations have regular trains running from major cities across the UK, such as York, London and Manchester. Trains run on a regular basis and take around 5 hours from London. Edinburgh Waverley is the larger of the two stations, although Haymarket is more convenient for the theatres.






By Road

As the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh enjoys easy access to the large motorway links that make their way up to and around the UK. If you're travelling from the north of Scotland, for example, Edinburgh is only 3 hours from Inverness and just over 2 hours from Aberdeen. Journey times from England are just as good; you can get to Edinburgh from Birmingham in about 5.5 hours, from Manchester and York in about 4 hours, and the city is just 2.5 hours from Newcastle.






By Air

With over 25 airlines offering flights to more than 100 airports in The UK, Europe and internationally, Edinburgh Airport is by far the busiest in Scotland. As well as regular UK connecting flights to the likes of London and Birmingham, Edinburgh is also a popular airport for flights to New York and Toronto. The airport is located 8 miles (12 km) west of the capital and has frequent transport links to the city centre.










Getting Around

Although Edinburgh is a very large city, the centre and tourist areas are best travelled around on foot or by bicycle. The historical and architecturally interesting  streets are most appreciated from the ground, although a very reliable and frequent series of bus services do run in the city. There is also a large selection of local train services that can take visitors further afield and out to The Lothian’s for more rural trips. Although taxi’s in Edinburgh can be expensive, they are very frequent and it’s a much easier way of travelling to your destination if you’re not so sure of your way around.




Top 3 Travel Tips


When driving, time your journey to avoid rush hour periods of 7.30am to 9.30am and 4.30pm to 6.30pm Monday to Friday

If you’re heading to Edinburgh for the theatre, Haymarket Train Station is the most convenient

If you’re flying, the Lothian Buses Airlink service 100 can take/ bring you to the airport for around £3 each way









By Bus

Buying a Day Ticket for Lothian Bus Services means you are able to travel wherever you want, as many times as you want and you only have to pay £3. First buses also operate in Edinburgh with around 300 services, however they are slightly more expensive. If you're heading further afield, you can buy your coach tickets for UK and Scottish travel from the bus station in St Andrew Square in advance.






By Taxi

Most of Edinburgh’s taxis are black cabs, which take up to five passengers. When a taxi’s yellow ‘For Hire’ light is on, you can hail it in the street. The basic fare, for the pick-up and the first 90 seconds of waiting time costs £1.60 (£2.70 between 6pm and 6am); each additional 45 seconds costs 25p. There’s a 20p charge for every additional passenger over two. Minicabs (saloon cars) are generally cheaper than black cabs and may be able to carry more passengers (specify when booking). Cars must be booked in advance. Reputable firms include Bluebird (0131 621 6666) and Persevere (0131 555 2323).






By Bike

If you don’t fancy using public transport but need to get around a little quicker than walking will allow, why not cycle? The city council has invested in some off-road cycle paths and road-edge cycle lanes (although it’s not compulsory for motorists to stick to the lanes), the lanes ease the flow of cyclists during rush hours and make some roads safer. Cyclists can travel freely along bus lanes.










Shopping

From arts & crafts to cutting edge fashion, designer jewellery to traditional Scottish kilts, shopping in Edinburgh is a fantastic experience. A great variety of shops reside in the city – some contemporary and housing high quality designer labels, others in elegant, historical buildings selling local produce and traditional Scottish wares. The Royal Mile, Princes Street and Grassmarket should be top of the list for any shopaholics visiting the city, as well as five shopping centres located around the outskirts. With so much variety, it’ll be hard to know where to start.

Top 10 Edinburgh Bars

2


Beehive Inn, 18-20 Grassmarket

One of the city's best traditional-style pubs serving a range of excellent real ales and a vast selection of malt whiskies.

Top 10 Edinburgh Attractions

th
and 17th-century Edinburgh.




2


Edinburgh Castle, Castlehill

8


Edinburgh Zoo, 134 Corstorphine Rd

Opened in 1913, Edinburgh Zoo is one of the world's leading conservation zoos. Edinburgh's captive breeding program has saved many endangered species, including Siberian tigers, pygmy hippos and red pandas.





9


Cramond

With its moored yachts, stately swans and whitewashed houses spilling down the hillside at the mouth of the River Almond, Cramond is the most picturesque corner of Edinburgh. It is also rich in history.




10


Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, 75 Belford Rd

Set in an impressive neoclassical building surrounded by a landscaped sculpture park some 500m west of Dean Village is the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.
