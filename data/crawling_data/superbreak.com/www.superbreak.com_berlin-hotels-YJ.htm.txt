Berlin Sightseeing Bus Tour
is a great way to see the sights of this enormous city in a short space of time. With several different tours available covering all the main sights, you won't miss a thing! Major sights include the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz and Checkpoint Charlie. You can also visit some alternative locations such as Prenzlauer Berg, the East Side Gallery and sites of the former Communist East Germany.

Berlin Walking Tours
offer an alternative to traditional sightseeing where you can explore Berlin's role during the cold war, the history of Jewish Berlin and even visit the site of Hitler's bunker. You could also choose to add a Berlin Welcome Card which gives you free transport on the city's buses and trains as well as discounted entry to many museums and attractions.

Berlin Zoo
is located next to the Tiergarten and houses more than 20,000 animals. From large animals such as hippos, giraffes and polar bears to tiny frogs, birds and fish; there are enough species to see to fill a whole day! Unusually, the zoo is right in the heart of Berlin, and as Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station is one of the city's main transport hubs, it is very easy to get to.
Make sure you indulge in the city night-life during your stay in one of our great hotels in Berlin. There are hundreds of bars and thousands of restaurants to discover. Whether you choose Michelin starred fine dining or sample the local delicacy Currywurst, your stay in one of our many Berlin hotels will be sure to suit everyone's tastes.
