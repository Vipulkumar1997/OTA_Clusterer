Welcome to our Dublin Guide




Welcome to our Dublin Guide. Amidst a turbulent history Dublin is said to be Europe’s friendliest city, with its excellent restaurants, chic boutiques and legendary pubs. Unmissable attractions include the Guinness Storehouse, the Old Jameson Distillery, Dublin Castle and Trinity College. Enjoy a voyage of discovery from the Arctic to the Plains of Africa via the Indian Rainforest at Dublin Zoo or walk down to Phoenix Park, the largest urban park in Europe. Dublin is great for all ages, whether it’s a short break with family, a shopping break with friends or a hen/stag weekend.
Our Dublin Guide is a great way to find out about the must do’s and see’s in Dublin as well as useful information about travelling to and around the city.
Dublin boasts two main shopping districts. On the north side of the river is Dublin’s largest shopping centre, The Jervis Centre. And on the south side is the fashionably upmarket Grafton Street where some of Dublin’s most exclusive designer shops can be found. The cobblestone streets of the Temple Bar district is by far the most popular area at night with around 24 bars and 73 cafes and restaurants to choose from. The dining scene in Dublin is booming and a new trend in Celtic cuisine, known as ‘modern Irish’ has become increasingly popular.
We hope that you find our Dublin Guide a useful resource when
planning your trip
.







Must do's by day




Sample a pint of the black stuff at Guinness Storehouse





Take a stroll through Phoenix Park, Europe’s largest urban park





Visit the exotic animals at the historic Dublin Zoo






Must do's by night

Dine out and sample native oysters and Dublin Bay prawns

Travelling to Dublin



Dublin Overview



Dublin has never been so accessible, with Dublin Airport and Dublin Port within easy reach of the city and county.




By Rail



The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is Dublin's main train service and stretches the full length of Dublin Bay, from Malahide in North County Dublin to Greystones in County Wicklow. You can connect to the regular train service for communities north of Dublin, right up to Belfast.




By Sea



Regular ferry services operate between Ireland and the UK bringing both foot passengers and cars through Dublin Port. Today three companies connect Dublin with Holyhead, Liverpool and the Isle of Man. These are Irish Ferries, Stena Line and P&O; Ferries.




By Air



Dublin International Airport is about 12km north from city centre, and is well serviced by buses and taxis. Flights from the UK take little over 1 hour and are available from
most regional UK airports
. The main carriers are Ryanair and Aer Lingus, although other companies do service Dublin too.






Getting Around in Dublin



Dublin Overview



Getting around Dublin is easy. Use the extensive public bus network for travelling around the city or there's the LUAS tram system and DART train service if you want to go further afield. The city is also easily navigated by bicycle.




By Bus



Dublin has an excellent network of bus services that provide frequent, reliable and cost effective travel throughout the city and region. This includes great services from Dublin Airport and Dublin Port as well as a NiteLink service.




By Bike



Hire a bike and explore the city on two wheels! DublinBikes is a citywide initiative encouraging locals and visitors alike to use bikes to move around the city. DublinBikes are free but you must register your details.
