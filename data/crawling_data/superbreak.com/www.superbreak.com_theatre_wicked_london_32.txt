Wicked Theatre Show Information

Experience the wonderful world of Oz on a Wicked The Musical Theatre Break!

About Wicked

In 2003, Wicked opened on Broadway and has taken the theatre world by storm ever since. Based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, the original Broadway production starred Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth. This magical story of love, friendship and power is sure to have you spellbound from the opening act.

The Story

This unforgettable tale lifts the lid on one of the most popular stories ever told, with an alternative perspective on ‘The Wizard of Oz’ that challenges our preconceptions for what we consider to be ‘good’ and what we consider to be ‘wicked’…

We follow the adventures of Glinda and Elphaba and their unlikely friendship, as they realise their destinies as 'Glinda the Good' and the infamous 'Wicked Witch of the West’. Stephen Schwartz and Joe Mantello lead a talented team in bringing the wonderful world of the Land of Oz to life, revealing a parallel world of witchcraft, fantasy and outstanding beauty.

Why Book Wicked The Musical Tickets With Super Break?

At Super Break, we've been providing memorable short breaks within the UK and Europe for over 30 years, and during this time we have built up strong relationships to present our customers with the best great-value offers possible. On a Wicked Theatre Break with Super Break, you can enjoy savings of up to 30% with our Top Price Saver Tickets, meaning that you get one of the best seats in the house and a London hotel stay at a great price.

Awards and What Do The Critics Think?

Wicked has received over 100 international awards and has been seen by over 7.5 million people at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London and over 50 million people worldwide. Its run at London’s Apollo puts it in the top 20 longest running West End theatre shows of all time.

The West End production has received 9 whatsonstage.com awards including Best West End Show & Best Musical plus an Olivier Award for Most Popular Show.

In a review by The Telegraph, “It gives you so much – a cast of 36; exotic, colourful scenery; flying monkeys – that you get ample bangs for your bucks, and by setting itself up as a “prequel” it doesn’t stake a claim to being a masterwork in its own right.”

About The Theatre

The Apollo Victoria Theatre has a heritage which goes back to 1929, when it opened up as a "state of the art" cinema. The theatre is Art Deco in style and is now decorated to reflect the sparkling Emerald City.

In February 2006, Wicked moved into the theatre, opening in September to overwhelming success. Wicked continues to be hugely popular, showing no signs of slowing down for the foreseeable future.

Directions

Exit Victoria Station and turn right. The theatre is on Wilton Road and is visible from the station exit. This is approximately a 2-minute walk.

What’s Nearby?

With Victoria Station just round the corner, there’s plenty of bars and restaurants nearby with enough choice to satisfy anyone’s mood. Whether you fancy a coffee, a pizza or even a pie at the pub, you’ll find it all right by The Apollo.
