Whipsnade Zoo is the UK’s largest zoo and is a great day out for animal lovers.

About ZSL Whipsnade Zoo

ZSL Whipsnade Zoo is home to a menagerie of animals, and visitors can see them in their huge outdoor enclosures and wander around the many fantastic animal exhibits. You can see the many beasts that walked our land in ‘Wild Wild Whipsnade’, featuring bears, moose lynx and reindeer, or you can head over to see the big cats in the ‘Lions of Serengeti’, as well as beasts and cats, you can meet the chimps in the ‘Chimpanasium’. There are also many more animal exhibits, including 'Elephant Herd', 'Cheetah Rock' and 'Birds of the World'.

Take a ride on the zoo's Jumbo Express; a steam engine which explores the territories of some of the most inspiring animals



What Makes it Super

A great day out for all the family, ZSL Whipsnade Zoo offers something for all ages. There is big fun for little ones at the ZSL Whipsnade Zoo’s family festival, and there is a fun-filled summer festival which includes giant games, bouncy castle, storytelling and face painting.

This is the first time I have visited a zoo in winter so was not sure what to expect.  It was brilliant.  All the animals are active, moving about, foraging and exploring and looking very content.  Excellent collection of healthy looking animals.  Nice to go when its quiet too without huge queues for everything.

But oh my aching feet.  The place is massive.

A different way of using the space and very nice for a hour with really nice displays all around and a welcome stop in the butterfly house to warm you back up. Definitely recommend if you can still get tickets!

Fab zoo, the drive around capability in Winter is a real godsend on a cold November weekend.

Animals are all housed in decent enclosures, you can get real close to some of them like the penguins and like, but give yourself enough time to get round.

this place is not cheap, they charge extra for cars, plus a "voluntary donation to conservation" bit of a chug (charity mug that) but who is going to say no and seem like eboneezer scroodge ?

but the concept of being able to drive around at your own pace, park up and go see stuff then go round again is just brilliant.  watch out for Maras _ cross between a large rabbit and capybara, an wallabies walking around freely !

the penguins at the start  like the rockhobbers and African black feet were so close one could almost scoop one up and bring them home (don't think we weren't tempted  ;0))

Unfortunately we began to run out of time as dusk set in and we could have seen so much more.  the hippos were moved to bed before the park closed so I only got a butt shot which was a shame !

the scandal is the cafe/restaurant, their prices would shame the National Trust  - £9 for bangers and mash is just daylight robbery.  Plus the Restaurant, staff are a tad aloof and rude as well, my wife struggled to find the required tea, the serving woman practically shoved me out of the way to seraphic the places I'd already looked.  for such a slow cold day  they were lethargic at tidying up left trays and mostly stood around waiting for customer (victims) to approach them

one last  thing to inspire - you can stay  in the zoo overnight - they have pods to rent.  we weren't brave enough  (or rich enough I suspect) to do this. but maybe I'll get my wife one for her birthday ! 
Do you hear growling ...... ?!!
