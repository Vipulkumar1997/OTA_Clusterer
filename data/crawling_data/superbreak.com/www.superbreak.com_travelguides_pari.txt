Welcome to our Paris Guide




For great tips and handy hints about how to get around, what to visit and where to shop, our Paris guide is at your service. Easily amongst the
best European cities for a short break or getaway
, Paris is likely to bring out the sightseer, the foodie, the romantic and the shopaholic in you all at once. With easy access via the Eurostar and regular flights, you could be enjoying the spectacular sophistication and incomparable culture of Paris in no time at all.
The French capital has an extraordinary list of must-see attractions; no trip to Paris is complete without seeing the iconic landmarks – the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and the pretty Notre Dame Cathedral to name just a few. The incredibly popular Louvre Museum and, a little out of town, the magical Disneyland Paris are both wonderful attractions if you have the time. For a more leisurely activity, try a relaxing cruise up the Seine or hire a bike and explore the city – visit the famous Pere Lachaise cemetery, the stunning Opera Garnier or the vibrant district of Le Marais.
When evening rolls around, be certain to take in gorgeous views of the City of Lights from a good vantage point – we recommend the Montparnasse Tower for a complete panorama of the city at night from up high. Round off your perfect Parisian day in a trendy bistro or catch a show at one of the famous cabarets – The Lido or The Moulin Rouge are both great choices.

Travelling to Paris



Paris Overview



With two major airports located close to the city and the Eurostar service running directly into the city centre, travelling to Paris is simple as well as great value for money.




By Road



With excellent road links Paris is easily accessible from all routes. Travelling from the North the A1 and A3 link to the Paris Ring Road - the Priphrique. While it is connected to the South via the A5 and A6.




By Air



Paris is served by two main airports, Charles De Gaulle International and Paris Orly, and both are well serviced by buses, taxis and the RER. Flights from the UK take just over 1 hour and are available from most regional UK airports.




By Eurostar



Eurostar breaks are available from St Pancras International to Gare Du Nord, placing you in the centre of Paris in less than 3 hours, relaxed and refreshed. Travel in style and comfort and enjoy easy check in, reserved seating and a bar buffet serving light refreshments.






Getting Around in Paris



Paris Overview



Paris has an excellent public transport system, consisting of taxis, buses, bicycle rental, underground metro and express trains (RER), the latter being the most cost effective. Or explore the city on foot; it's a great way to get off the well trodden, tourist trail.




By Bus



The bus system is extensive, but is obviously slower and less frequent than the metro and RER. Buses are best used for getting to destinations these do not service.




By Bike



Much safer than in London, Paris is a Bike-friendly city – so much so that seeing Paris on two wheels is a quintessential experience on your short break.




By Metro



The quickest and easiest way to get around is on the underground metro and RER. You can transfer between the two at no extra cost.

Getting to Paris

Paris is ideally situated for a short break on the continent with Eurostar trains transporting passengers from London's St Pancras International to 'Paris' Gare du Nord station in under 3 hours, meaning visitors to the City of Light can easily swap lunch by the Thames for dinner by the Seine. As France's capital city, Paris is well connected to the nation's major roads, and is roughly a 3 hour drive from Calais for visitors travelling to France via the ferry with their own car.
Flying to Paris is also an easy option
, as the city is served by two major airports; both located less than an hour's drive from the centre of Paris and well connected to the city's public transport systems.




Top 3 Travel Tips


To get to or from Charles De Gaulle and Paris Orly airports, take the RER line B3 to the Antony stop then pick up the Orlyval metro or the Air France Shuttle Bus

For larger, comfier seats on your Eurostar journey to Paris upgrades to Standard Premier Class are available.

As a guide, you can expect an average taxi fare of €25 during the day and €30 at night from Paris Orly Airport into the centre of Paris.









By Rail

Paris is well connected to the UK and most of the rest of the world as it is served by two main airports, Charles De Gaulle International and Paris Orly. Travelling to and from the airports from the centre of Paris is easy as and both are well serviced by buses, taxis and the RER train network. Flights from the UK take between 1 and two hours and are available from London Heathrow as well as most regional UK airports such as Liverpool and Birmingham.






By Road

Paris is well connected to France's road network, with the Paris Ring Road, the Priphrique, offering access to the A1 and A3 to the north of the city and the A5 and the A6 to the south. Drivers travelling over from the UK via ferries from Dover to Calais can drive to Paris in around 3 hours, heading south along the A16. Passengers arriving with their cars in Caen or Le Havre after taking the ferry from Portsmouth can drive to Paris in just over 2 hours, travelling south-east on the A13.






By Eurostar

Eurostar trains from London's St Pancras International station to Paris' Gare du Nord station take approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes. Visitors travelling from the south east can also depart from Ebbsfleet and Ashford International stations. A great thing about travelling on the Eurostar is there's no need to worry about checking-in your bags or how much your case weighs. There isn't a separate check-in for baggage as long as you haven't got more than two medium suitcases and one piece of hand luggage per person, so it's perfect for travelling back with all your souvenirs!










Getting Around Paris

Paris has an excellent public transport system, with an extensive underground metro network in the city centre and express trains (RER) that connect the city with the Parisian suburbs and beyond. Getting around the city centre by bus or taxi is also a viable option if you prefer to stay above ground! Alternatively, exploring on foot, hiring a bike or a scooter or even travelling along the river Seine are excellent ways to take in the sights while you find your way around.




Top 3 Travel Tips


Retro style scooters are available to hire from Free Scoot in the 11th arrondissement from 30 Euros a day for adults over 21. Prices include insurance, helmets and gloves.

If you're staying for more than a week, the cheapest way to use public transport in Paris is to get a combined travel pass that allows unlimited travel on the metro, RER and buses.

For a flexible, hop-on, hop-off approach to cruising on the Seine, sail with the Compagnie de Batobus. Adult day passes are from 12 Euros and boats depart every 15 to 30 minutes from various stops.









By Bus

The Paris bus system is extensive, but is slower and less frequent than the underground metro and RER network. However, travelling by bus is a more picturesque way of moving around the city and taking in the views as you get to stay above ground! You must validate your T+ ticket as soon as you get on the bus and your ticket is then valid for 90 minutes and can be used on any bus within this timeframe. Packets of 10 T+ tickets called 'un carnet' are available from street tobacconists or at the metro stations.






By Bike

Hiring bikes in Paris is easy with the Vlib system. Pick up a bike at any of the city's metro stations or at one of the many bike stands, ride around for half an hour for free then leave it at one of the Vlib stands at your chosen destination. For longer journeys or if you're staying in Paris for a while, 1-day or 7-day Vlib' tickets are available to buy from any of the Vlib' Service Points. The Vlib bikes are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and can be used by anyone over the age of 14.






By Metro

With one of the densest city centre transport systems in the world the quickest and easiest way to get around Paris is on the underground metro and RER. There are 16 metro lines and over 300 stops across the city making every corner of Paris easily accessible. You can transfer between the metro and the RER at no extra cost. Travel cards are available for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days, for either zones 1-3 covering the centre of Paris, or zones 1-5 covering the whole of the network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris.










Shopping in Paris

Designer boutiques such as Chanel, Hermes, and YSL can be found on the stylish Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor as well as on the iconic Champs-Elyses.
