Travelling to Amsterdam



Amsterdam Overview



Due to its location across the North Sea, travelling by ferry has become incredibly fashionable thanks to low prices and the ability to take your car. Schiphol ferry port and the airport are less than two hours away from Amsterdam by road, leaving the rest of the day to explore. Travelling by train and road are also possibilities.




By Rail



Thanks to the Eurostar, travelling by rail is an easy way to get to Amsterdam. Services run from London St. Pancras and takes 2 hours to get to Brussels. From there, the Thalys connecting train will be in Amsterdam Central Station in less than 2 hours.




By Air



Frequent flights run from all London airports and Leeds/Bradford airport amongst others, and take approximately 1 hour 15 minutes to arrive at Schiphol Airport. From there trains and buses run to the Centre of Amsterdam in under 2 hours.






Getting Around in Amsterdam



Amsterdam Overview



From central station where most visitors will arrive or be dropped off, Dam Square with the likes of Madame Tussauds is a gentle five minute walk away. Trams are the most popular form of transport but you will also find a strong cycling culture.




By Bus



Although not as frequent as the trams, buses in Amsterdam are a great way to see as much of the city as you can without having to spend a lot of money. Again, a longer route will allow you to see more of Amsterdam.




By Tram



Frequent, efficient and reliable, Amsterdam’s tram links are the best way to travel further afield around Amsterdam. 10 tram lines run from Central Station meaning wherever you’re staying or wish to visit, it’s easy to get there. Why not take the longest route so you can see more of the city?




By Bike



As soon as you arrive in Amsterdam, the amount of cyclists around is likely to surprise you. Don’t worry though as there’s plenty of dedicated bike lanes. It’s a quick and easy way to go wherever you want in Amsterdam

Getting to Amsterdam

As one of the most popular destinations for European short breaks, Amsterdam has numerous ways and means by which to get there. Settled just off the North Sea, ferry travel is the easiest and most common way to travel. Although not the quickest, the journey allows guests to begin their holiday as soon as they step onboard, and not simply wait to get to Amsterdam. With great restaurants, evening entertainment and some fabulous views, travelling by ferry is a great way to get there. Eurostar is the quickest way to travel, taking two hours to reach Brussels from London St. Pancras and a further two to get to Amsterdam Central.
Flying to Schiphol is another option
, and travelling by road through France and Belgium is also popular.




Top 3 Travel Tips


When travelling by ferry, be sure to take sea-sickness tablets with you as the journey across the North Sea can sometimes be rough.

If arriving by train, Amsterdam Central provides lockers for a deposit where you can leave any luggage to save you carrying it around with you all day.

Book your ferry meals in advance as you can save money and won’t be disappointed if you can’t get a table.









By Rail
Eurostar travel has become incredibly popular when heading to France, Holland, Germany and Belgium. It’s one of the quickest ways to get there, with travelling time being around four hours and the connecting train taking you directly into Amsterdam Central Station. Guests can set off at lunchtime in London and arrive in Amsterdam for their evening meal, giving them plenty of time to settle into their hotel ready for the next day. When booking in advance, Eurostar short breaks cost around £200pp based on a two night stay.





By Air
Flying to Amsterdam is not the most common way to travel but it is definitely the quickest. Flying only takes just over an hour from London, and arrives at Schiphol airport ready for the same transfers as the ferry would receive. Three hours from start to finish and you can be in the city centre.





By Ferry
As the most popular way to travel, ferries leave from both Newcastle and Hull ports very frequently. Due to the length of the trip, ferries will usually depart early evening and travel overnight, allowing guests the chance to enjoy the onboard facilities, sleep and arrive in Amsterdam early the next morning with the whole day to explore. Once guests arrive at Schiphol ferry port, the coach transfer takes around 2 hours to reach Amsterdam Central Station, just a short walk from all the major attractions.









Getting Around Amsterdam

With most of the main attractions and hotspots in the centre, getting around Amsterdam is easy. Walking is the most common way to move around as you can enjoy the sights sounds and smells of the city whilst you make your way to your destination. To move a little further afield or to make your way to and from your hotel, the frequent and reliable tram system is an easy way to do so, and at a low cost too. Cycling in Amsterdam is part of the culture. Dedicated cycle lanes are heavily used by locals and visitors alike. Hire a bike and spend the day cycling around this scenic city to see what you can discover.




Top 3 Travel Tips


Bikes do not stop! If you’re crossing the road or wandering around be careful near the cycle lanes

If you’re using the tram, why not take the longest route so you get to see as much of Amsterdam as possible?

Make sure you keep your map on you while you’re walking around. It’s easy to get lost among the similar looking streets and canals









On Foot
All of the main attractions are in the centre of Amsterdam, all within an easy walk of Amsterdam Central Station which is where most visitors will arrive and be dropped off. Once you leave the station, straight in front of you are the streets that lead to Dam Square, lined with museums, speciality shops, bus tours and street food stalls. Walking around means you don’t miss any of the little hidden gems that are tucked in the side streets and you can really enjoy authentic Amsterdam





By Tram
For travelling further afield to a hotel or perhaps to take a look around the windmills, using the tram is a quick and efficient way of moving around.  With ten different routes leaving from Central Station, there’s nowhere that you can’t get to, and with an all day ticket costing as little as 22 Euros it’s a great value way to explore. If you have luggage with you that you don’t want to carry around all day, there are lockers inside Central Station where you can lock away your things and travel freely, all for the lowly price of 7 Euros for 24 hours use of a large locker. Some of the machines only accept card payments so make sure you have everything prepared.





By Bike
With a nice flat landscape and dedicated cycling lanes, hiring a bike in Amsterdam is a great way to get around – and it’s more fun than walking. You can find bike rental outlets throughout the city such as MacBike and Amsterbike, as it’s a really popular way to explore. As long as you listen to the rules that the vendor tells you, and follow the cycling codes correctly, it’ll be a great addition to your memories of Amsterdam. Prices vary but on average it costs 7 Euros a day to hire a bike.









Shopping in Amsterdam

Amsterdam is full of variety when it comes to shopping. With everything from huge department stores to vintage boutiques and bustling flea markets, shopping in Amsterdam is a great experience. ‘The Nine Streets’ is the busiest shopping district and is right in the city centre. Intersecting the main canals, nine streets within the Leidsestraat and the Jordaan districts are lined with jewelers, museums, boutiques, cafes and art galleries, and have an exceptional array of style, trends and prices. The P.C. Hooftstraat is Amsterdam’s most luxurious shopping streets, selling brands such as Louis Vuitton and DKNY, and for traditional department store products, De Bijenkorf is located right in Dam Square.

Eating out in Amsterdam

Generally speaking Dutch food is simple, hearty, meat-and-potatoes type fare. Favourites include erwtensoep (pea soup with ham and smoked sausage), stamppot (mashed potatoes mixed with vegetables, served with meat and gravy) and suddervlees (slowly braised meat). Thanks to its proximity to the sea, fish and seafood also feature heavily on Dutch menus, especially plaice, mackerel, eel, mussels and shrimp. The Dutch are also crazy for their friet (chips/fries)! Even upscale restaurants often serve their meals with a side of friet and mayonnaise. Restaurants also cater for the many tourists that visit by providing the best of international food, as well as the usual chain restaurants you find throughout Europe.
