Matilda The Musical Theatre Show Information

Enjoy this hilarious adaptation of Roald Dahl's well-loved tale of the little girl with magical powers.

About Matilda The Musical

Following a hugely successful run in Stratford upon Avon, Matilda the Musical has taken over London’s Cambridge Theatre. Roald Dahl’s much loved story has been brought to life by Dennis Kelly and award-winning comedian and musician Tim Minchin, meaning fantastic Matilda the Musical theatre breaks are now available for everyone to enjoy.

The Story

Matilda the Musical follows the story of an ordinary girl with extraordinary powers. Matilda Wormwood’s parents think she is nothing but a nuisance where as she thinks they care more about the TV than her. When they are not slouched in front of the telly, she is ignored by her mother in favour of ballroom dancing and by her father for dodgy business deals. At school Matilda life isn’t much better with the monstrous Miss Trunchbull terrifying the students and teachers, that is until one day Matilda discovers her powers and decides the grown-ups need to be taught a lesson.

History of Matilda The Musical

In 1996 the fantastic story of Matilda was adapted into a film and now the stage adaptation is taking the theatre world by storm. Don’t miss out on your chance to experience a Matilda the Musical theatre break and witness the much-loved show that has been crowned with the Peter Heppie Award for Best Musical at The Critics Circle Award.

Show was great, tickets terrible - back of theatre yet we were advised there would not be restricted view. Especially when actors at front of stage which was quite often and then could not see a thing.
