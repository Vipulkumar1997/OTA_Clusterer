The Phantom of the Opera Theatre Show Information

Phantom of the Opera tells the enchanting tale of an opera house ghost.

About Phantom of the Opera

The most successful musical of all time and widely regarded as Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s best ever theatrical masterpiece, The Phantom of the Opera has won countless awards, including both the Olivier and Tony Awards for Best Musical. Having been seen by over 140 million people, the show is immensely popular with critics and audiences alike, and with its iconic songs and astounding set, The Phantom of the Opera is simply a must-see for every theatre lover.

The Story

Set around the Paris Opera, the story follows chorus girl Christine Daae as she finally gets her big break – the Phantom teaches his young protegee in his lair beneath the majestic Opera House, where he hides from all who fear him far above. Besotted with the beautiful Christine and determined that she will sing the lead in the opera for him, the Phantom will do anything to see his plans through.

History of Phantom of the Opera

Based on Gaston Leroux’s classic 1911 novel, this incredible story has continued to captivate audiences around the world and is widely-regarded as the most romantic musical ever made. The show opened at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1986 with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman starring in the leading roles, and was transferred to the screen in 2004 with a film directed by Joel Schumacher.

The show is as brilliant as ever. However if you have seen this before you may be slightly disappointed with the three main cast members. They are ok but I have seen and heard better, but this is just my opinion and others may disagree.
We had great seats but were surrounded by students from Germany, but they were well mannered and a credit to the institution they were from.
