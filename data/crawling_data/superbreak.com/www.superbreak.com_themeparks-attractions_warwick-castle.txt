Good for children. The castle is okay but not brilliant. We went in December and there looked like there lots of happy families there. Must be good in the summer. 
There are extra costs costs. Some of which are ..........
£6 to park your car
£5 for archery 
£12 for pizza and a drink (advertised as all you can eat).
£9 for a "dungeon experience".  
There was a bird of pray display while we there. This was absolutely brilliant. 
Looked like there was an adventure playground and a maze. 
Warwick Castle is okay but it feels very "commercial" and set up to get your money.

We visited the castle on a short trip to Warwick and were not disappointed.
Booking in advance saved us some money and avoided queues for tickets on the day.
The castle is well preserved and is a great piece of history with plenty of interesting exhibits.
The history of the castle is well explained and there are a number of guided tours throughout the day.
Don't miss the dungeon experience and the bird of prey display.
More things to do in summer but still a great day out at anytime.

I was disappointed that this beautiful historic property was turned into an amusement style attraction (Disneyland like). I did not feel it was worthwhile for just adults. Families with younger children may get more out of this. I spent less than an hour and saw all I needed to see. The town of Warwick was much more interesting to me than this commercialized tour stop.
