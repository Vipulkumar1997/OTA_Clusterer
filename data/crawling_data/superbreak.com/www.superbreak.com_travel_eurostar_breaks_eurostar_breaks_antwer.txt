Going on a Eurostar Break









Minimum Check-in Time
Check in at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure, however please allow enough time to collect your tickets and allow for any potential delays getting to the station. If you get there early then why not treat yourself to a coffee & croissant!


Collect Your Tickets
Upon arrival at the station, simply enter your Eurostar reference number into any of the 'Quick Ticket' machines in the ticket hall or if you get stuck just ask any member of the Eurostar terminal staff who will be happy to help.


Baggage Allowance
No need to worry about checking-in your bags or how much your case weighs. There isn't a separate check-in for baggage at Eurostar as long as you haven't got more than two medium sized suitcase bags or cases and one piece of hand luggage per person. Excess baggage charges apply to any additional items and bulky luggage or sports equipment.


Seats Are Reserved
Your seats have been reserved, so there's no need to worry about booking them separately! Your seat numbers will be shown on your tickets when you print them off.


Passports & Visas
Please ensure you have a valid passport and - if required - a visa for your visit. Border formalities are completed on each departure by both UK and French immigration authorities.
