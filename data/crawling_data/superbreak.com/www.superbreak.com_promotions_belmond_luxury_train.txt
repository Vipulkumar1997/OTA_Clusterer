Belmond Luxury Day Trips














Celebrate the release of Kenneth Brannagh's Murder on the Orient Express and treat yourself to a luxury day trip aboard the Belmond British Pullman or Northern Belle. Whether you are enjoying the best of Britain on a day trip or getting into the spirit of Poirot on a Murder Mystery, these journeys are as dignified as they are effortlessly glamourous. Book one of our Belmond British Pullman or Northern Belle trips and return to a bygone era of luxury, comfort and style.
Prices start from £225pp.



Call 01904 717 362 to book and a friendly advisor will be able to help you find your perfect luxury trip.








About Our Belmond Luxury Train Breaks
















Sister trains to the legendary Venice Simplon-Orient Express, the Belmond British Pullman and Northern Belle captivate and enthral with a stylish collection of day excursions and experiences across the UK. Whichever day trip you choose you'll enjoy silver service dining, fine wines and champagne in the luxurious surroundings of the Belmond British Pullman and Belmond Northern Belle's vintage carriages.


“Step on board and the real world evaporates behind you” is a sentiment often voiced by travellers on the Belmond British Pullman train. Together with the Northern Belle, the magnificent period carriages enable guests to experience all the magic of a 30s era journey with the comforts of modern day hospitality.
















Both trains offer day and weekend trips from London and other regional cities to spectacular UK destinations. To sit within these parlour cars is to travel in a work of art: the Belmond British Pullman consists of restored vintage carriages, while on the Belmond Northern Belle trips you will see the exquisite marquetry panels. Choose from a variety of experiences including day trips to historic towns such as Lincoln and Harrogate or relax amidst the train's luxurious surroundings and enjoy entertainment ranging from murder mystery plots or even close-up table magic.


Fine dining is a highlight of every journey. Trips include a sumptuous, silver service dinner extravaganza, whilst you can also enjoy a delicious brunch on many of the sightseeing journeys. When visiting Britain's greatest cities, gardens, castles and sporting events aboard these luxury trains, the journey is as exciting as the destination.
