Kensington Palace Breaks

An utterly gorgeous building full of fascinating Royal history, Kensington Palace is well worth a visit.

About Kensington Palace

The official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the former residence of Queen Victoria, Princess Diana and Princess Margaret among others. With a wonderful exhibition of famous dresses and gowns including those of Princess Diana, the magnificent King's and Queen's State Apartments – adorned with stunning paintings from the Royal Collection – and the famous Orangery Restaurant in which to enjoy afternoon tea, be sure to take your time to discover the Palace’s incredible royal secrets.

Kensington Palace Highlights


Official London residence of Prince William and Kate Middleton

Former residence of Princess Diana and Queen Victoria

Home to royalty for over 300 years

Beautiful 18th century-inspired gardens

Enjoy afternoon tea in the Orangery Restaurant

View the dresses worn by Princess Diana and the Queen




What Makes it Super

The beautiful Kensington Palace gardens are reason enough to visit the attraction. The lavish gardens are inspired by the famous lawns of the 18th century. The iconic gardens are the perfect place to settle down with a picnic after a day of exploring the attraction and exhibitions.

New: Celebrate the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, in this major new dress exhibition at Kensington Palace.

Trace the evolution of the Princess’s style, from the demure, romantic outfits of her first public appearances, to the glamour, elegance and confidence of her later life. Don’t miss an extraordinary collection of garments, including the iconic velvet gown, famously worn at the White House when the Princess danced with John Travolta.

I tried to book tickets for me and my daughter to visit Princess Di’s exhibition but the booking system advised that it was full. I then realised that you get to see them within the full visit of Kensington Palace so I booked that way. 
We were staying next to Hyde Park so had a brisk ten minute walk to Kensington Palace.  
There was a very short queue to enter and we started by having a drink in the wonderful coffee shop. There were some lovely bits on sale in the adjoining shop too.
Princess Di’s dresses were amazing - just wonderful to see the black gown worn when she danced with John Travolta and the others were wonderful too. 
A rather quick tour but if you’re a Princess Di fan I’d recommend. 
Toilets were plentiful and clean.

You don't get to see a lot. The rooms have very little furniture in and the whole visit took less than an hour or so. Princess Diana's dresses are currently on show but not a lot to say other than I didn't realise how skinny she was.

Having been watching Victoria on tv, I was interested to go here on a recent visit to London only to find that the section devoted to Queen Victoria was closed. It was a huge disappointment. I did enjoy the rest of the tour, especially Diana's dresses. The rooms are quite dimly lit which made reading the information that bit more difficult. We spent a lot of time in the gardens and park area on a crisp autumnal day. I will probably go back when the exhibition reopens although it is rather pricey.

Went with my daughter and a friend.  We parked in a car park right next to the place under a hotel for £40 for the day, well worth it.  We went to see the Diana exhibition but enjoyed the palace as well.  The exhibition was really interesting with lots of information about Diana's life.  I was amazed how much I remembered about her and how many memories of my own life it brought back.  Some parts were quite sad as you remember what a lovely lady she was. even so I really enjoyed the visit.  We had coffee and cake in the coffee shop, which even had gluten free cake.

Arrived about 10am and had no trouble with line ups etc. Cost was 19.00GBP for one adult which forme seemed reasonable. It wont take you too long to go through, probably 1.5 - 2 hours tops. The Diana exhibit was on and included in the ticket and although I confess I was not too fussed about it, once I entered and begun to read about her choices of dress etc, I found the whole exhibition to be most enlightening.

No it is not the biggest and the best but if you accept it for what it is I am sure you will enjoy it.
