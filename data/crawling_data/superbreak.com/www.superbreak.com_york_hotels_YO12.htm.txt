York Minster








The
city of York
is easily one of the UK's most popular short break destinations. Thousands of visitors flock to see this picturesque city each year for its fascinating history, fabulous shopping and a whole wealth of great attractions too. Our superb range of York hotels offer an ideal retreat after a long day of shopping and sightseeing; the medieval city is fairly compact and easy to explore ? the gorgeous York Minster, Clifford?s Tower, the famous cobbled street The Shambles and the Jorvik Viking Centre are all within easy walking distance of most central hotels in York.
Perfect for a weekend break or a cultural getaway, use our hotels in York as a base for exploring the pretty Yorkshire countryside not far outside the city; the North York Moors are just a short drive away, and the vibrant cities of Leeds and Harrogate are both easily reached too. Our
two night dinner deals packages
are a fantastic option for a replenishing meal once you return to your hotel, or take advantage of York?s sublime gastro-culture and treat yourself at one of the city?s many fine dining restaurants.
Our York hotels benefit from great transport links and the city is an excellent choice for a rail break ? ideally placed on the high speed East Coast Mainline, York is a mere two hours from London and only two and a half hours from Edinburgh. A city with a proud heritage, the terrific National Railway Museum is one of York?s busiest attractions or, to add something extra to your stay, be sure to take a scary York Ghost Walk for a short break with a difference.
