Super Break's Top Tips for Discovering Somewhere New

Discover Akureyri, Iceland's best kept secret! The second largest town in Iceland is located just 60 miles from the Arctic Circle and is the perfect base to explore North Iceland.


Flying from eleven regional airports, these are the only direct flights to Akureyri from the UK and all come with a generous baggage allowance of 20kgs per person, services of a Super Break representative in Akureyri as well as transfers from Aukureyri Airport to the hotels. 
North Iceland Holidays include a choice of five hotels, from the 3* Hotel Nordurland to the 4* Saeluhus Akureyri.


Super Break's North Iceland breaks also include two amazing excursions. Discover the beautiful Lake Myvatn geothermal area and visit the famous Godafoss waterfall and the Dimmuborgir lava formations. Take a trip out into the countryside to search for the Northern Lights - North Iceland is one of the best places to witness the beautiful Aurora Borealis.

Free group place special offer on the Incredible Iceland package departing from Stansted Airport on 19th February - one free place for every ten passengers confirmed. Contact our Groups department on 01904 420 454 to book before 30th November.

Customer Testimonials









Just like to send you a massive thank you for the organisation of our trip to Prague. Everything went very well no hiccups, fantastic trip.







Back in March you kindly organised a school trip to Stratford-upon-Avon for our pupils at Eastbourne College, which we went on this June. The teachers and pupils all had a wonderful time and they wanted to express their thanks to you and your team.  It was so well put together and everything went very smoothly.  The Falcon Hotel was an excellent place for them to stay. Thanks again!
