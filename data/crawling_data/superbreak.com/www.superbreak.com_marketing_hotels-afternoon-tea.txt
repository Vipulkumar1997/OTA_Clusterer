Afternoon Tea: Jam Or Cream First?

It's a debate that divides the nation... but which way will prevail? Take a peek at our video and see!









Afternoon Tea Break Top Tip














Choosing the perfect afternoon tea can be tough! With that in mind, organisation is key. Plenty of hotels describe their afternoon teas in detail on their own websites, so you can research a selection of them before picking your favourite one to be transformed into a SuperBreak! Are you in the mood for delicate patisserie or do you prefer a generous wedge of cake? Will you opt for traditional cucumber sandwiches or a variety of savoury delicacies? The choice is yours! What's more, with a
luxury hotel break
you can make your trip away even more indulgent.
