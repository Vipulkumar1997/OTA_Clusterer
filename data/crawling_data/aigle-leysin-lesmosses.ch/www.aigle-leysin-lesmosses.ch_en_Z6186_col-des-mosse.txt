Col des Mosses
A cross-country skiing paradise, Les Mosses also attracts downhill skiing enthusiasts from a young age and hikers in the summer.
The climate in Les Mosses guarantees generous snow cover, even pre-season. Linked with Leysin, the ski area is ideal for families with its learner slopes and the 42 km of cross-country trails and 38 km of snow-shoe trails make it the Nordic Area of the Vaudois Alps. With a programme of events throughout the winter, the Nordic area specialises in activities related to the biathlon, combining cross-country skiing and shooting.
In the summer, the snow gives way to a lush green landscape criss-crossed by marked trails for walkers and cyclists. To reach the Pic Chaussy, the high point of the region at 2,351 m, walkers pass Lake Lioson, the pearl of alpine lakes, crossing paths with the seasoned fishermen there. A regular venue for cycling grand tours, climbing the Col des Mosses is a legendary challenge.
From June to September, there is a weekly flea market on Sundays with over 50 sellers from all over Switzerland.
