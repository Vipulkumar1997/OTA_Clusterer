Skiing
For winter sports enthusiasts there’s 100 kilometres worth of ski runs in the region of Leysin, Les Mosses and La Lécherette.
It’s easy to get to the pistes in the very heart of the Vaud Alps and with attractive prices they are the ideal destination for skiing and snowboarding. With sunshine as well as snow canons that guarantee snow cover right down to the village and a new chairlift, everything is set up so that you can enjoy winter sports at their best.
For families, the fun-filled snow gardens as well as beginners slopes are specially designed with tiny tots in mind. The more experienced get their adrenalin rush in the tailor-made snow parks. Dotted all over the entire ski area, picturesque mountain cafés and restaurants offer revitalising refreshments in stunning surroundings.
