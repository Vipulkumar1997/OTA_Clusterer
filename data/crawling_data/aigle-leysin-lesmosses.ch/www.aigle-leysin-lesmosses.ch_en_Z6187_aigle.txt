Aigle
Nestled between mountains and vines, Aigle Castle protects the authentic old town of Aigle and its picturesque streets.
From the centre of the village, it’s a short train ride to the mountain resorts and the shores of Lake Geneva making Aigle the ideal base for lots of days out, except there’s already so much to do here!
The lovingly restored mediaeval castle houses the collections of the Vine and Wine Museum, with a wealth of knowledge on vine growing. The surrounding vines produce fine wines known throughout Switzerland, mainly using the king grape variety, the chasselas, and the cream of these white wines come to the castle for a unique annual event: the Mondial du Chasselas.
Aigle also has an Adventure Park with 11 treetop trails, the Montreux Golf Club with its 18-holes under ancient trees and the Centre Mondial du Cyclisme (CMC). The headquarters of the International Cycling Union, it also has a range of tracks and cutting-edge facilities offering the athletes of the future the best possible training conditions.
