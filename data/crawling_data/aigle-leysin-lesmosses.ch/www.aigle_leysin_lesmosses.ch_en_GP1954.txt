Restaurants and mountain cafés
High altitude restaurants and cafés in the Leysin and Col des Mosses region offer energy-boosting refreshments in locations of breathtaking beauty.
After a hike or inbetween ski runs, taking a break not only recharges your batteries but provides a sociable interlude to share with friends. Most mountain restaurants offer gourmet menus with the accent on regional specialities ; naturally that often involves a variety of cheese dishes.
Café terraces are more often than not south facing for maximum sunshine exposure and breathtaking panoramic mountain views. On a sunbed or under a parasol, time can deliciously appear to stand still. To get warm in the winter, the top spot is just in front of the fireplace with friends and family where everyone can share experiences about their day out together.
