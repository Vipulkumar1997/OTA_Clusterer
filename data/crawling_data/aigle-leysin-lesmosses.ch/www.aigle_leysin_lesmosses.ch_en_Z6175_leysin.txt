Leysin
In the village or at the top of the Berneuse, Leysin has lots to offer, winter and summer, business or pleasure.
In Leysin, the Berneuse (2048 m) is where mountain enthusiasts meet. Here, at the top, the unique revolving restaurant, Le Kuklos, offers a 360 degree panoramic view of Lake Geneva and the Alps (the Dents du Midi, Tours d’Aï, Cervin and so on). After admiring the view and having their fill of sunshine, visitors can enjoy a huge array of activities including skiing in winter and hiking in the summer.
The village itself also has lots in store: in winter, freestylers practice in the snowpark, while families have fun in the Tobogganing Park. Created by Silvio Giobellina – Olympic medalist and bobsleigh world champion – this unique and slightly chilly attraction has some ten “snowtubing” slopes to hurtle down on an inner tube.
A mountain of fun at attractive prices, Leysin is a popular resort with families, who benefit from plainty of adapted infrastructures.

Les Mosses
The Nordic skiing area and the well-covered trails of Les Mosses-La Lécherette offer the best conditions for cross-country skiers from early in the season. Here, the cross-country season is one of the longest in Switzerland, since due to its particular altitude and climate, visitors can continue to enjoy skiing until mid-April.
