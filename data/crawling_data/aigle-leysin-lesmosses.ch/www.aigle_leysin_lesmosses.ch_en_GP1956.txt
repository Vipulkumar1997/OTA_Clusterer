Culture and heritage
For a touch of culture when holidaying in the Aigle, Leysin and Col des Mosses region, there are many authentic visits on offer as well as fun-filled tours in museums.
This region boasts a rich past with ancestral traditions still in evidence. A good example is to be found in the mountain cheese farms where today you can still watch how they make their cheese in a time honoured fashion.
In the Aigle area, vineyard culture is embedded in the very psyche. Aigle Château’s Vine and Wine Museum spotlights in detail the daily duties of the local winegrower right up to the creation of this fine beverage, emblematic of the region.
