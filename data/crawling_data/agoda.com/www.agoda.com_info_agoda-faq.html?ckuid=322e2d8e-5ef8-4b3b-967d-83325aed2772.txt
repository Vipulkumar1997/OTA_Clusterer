FAQs










Got a question? We've got answers.

To save you time, we've put answers to the most common inquiries here. Just click on the category and look for your question.





Making a new booking





Are the room rates inclusive of tax and service charge?



The default setting for Agoda's price display does not include tax and service charges. To see room rates with tax and service charges included, you may select ‘Total price per night’ under Price display in the currency tab at the top of the screen. Depending on your selected settings under the currency tab, displayed room rates will note if the price listed does or does not include tax or service charges. You may also view the total price for a stay by continuing to the booking form.





What are the charges for taxes & services?



In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the charge to your credit card will include a charge for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.

Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.

For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.





Why is there more than one rate for the same room type?



Different rates are due to the different promotions being offered by a hotel at any given time.





How do I know if a discount has been given?



All promotional rates displayed are already discounted. Information regarding specific hotel promotions are also displayed on the booking form.  For more details, please continue to the booking form.





What does Hot Deal, Non-refundable, Special conditions, etc stated next to my room type mean?



Hot Deal, Non-refundable, Special conditions, etc is an indication of a special promotion with some form of discount for a particular hotel, room type or period of stay. Bookings under promotion usually have a very strict cancellation policy which often results in a full period charge. Please make sure to read the booking conditions carefully before you submit your reservation.





Are the room rates per person or per room?



The rates displayed are per room, NOT per person. It is important that you input the correct number of guests associated with this booking as rates may change based on occupancy. In some instances, a hotel limits the number of guests per room. To avoid additional charges when you check in, the number of guests must be accurate.





Can Agoda recommend a hotel for my stay?



While Agoda cannot provide specific travel advice, we do provide verified reviews from real travelers, as well as complete information regarding facilities, locations, and star ratings. By default, your search results will be sorted based our recommendations for the best value and most reliable partner properties.





Can I add an extra bed/baby cot in my room?



Most hotels allow children to stay in the room with parents either with or without an extra bed. The normal hotel policy is not to charge for children if they are under twelve years of age. Some hotels will limit occupancy of a room to two adults and one child. Only a few hotels will have existing bedding for additional children, so an extra bed is usually required. Most hotels will charge for this extra bed. Usually hotels will provide breakfast when there is a charge for an extra bed. However, this is dependent on each property's policies and procedures. A baby cot may be provided free of charge, by some hotels, for children under the age of 2.





Can I book a room type that is not listed with Agoda?



No. Only those room types available will be displayed after you enter your travel requirements.





Can I make a booking for a check in date of today on the Agoda website?



Yes, this is possible as long as the room is available on the Agoda website when you make a search.





Can I make a reservation directly through the hotel?



Of course you can; however, Agoda often offers prices that are 10%-30% lower than many hotel's direct booking prices. Additionally, we offer benefits like Pay Later, Free Cancellation, and Low Price Guarantee that you won't get by booking directly.





Can I remove the transfer service if I don’t want it?



When a transfer service is listed, it's usually a requirement in order to get to your hotel of choice. You can choose not to use the service but hotels will be reluctant to remove the fee. You will need to negotiate with the hotel upon arrival.





Do you offer special discounts for senior citizens, airline employees, hotel member cards or Government officials?



No further discounts are available unless noted on the hotel page.





How can I check for budget hotels?



After inputting your destination and travel dates into the search box, you will be redirected to the search results page. Here, you can sort the results based on price, star rating, or special deals. You may also filter your search results by price range, preferred star rating, or accommodation type to find budget accommodation.





How can I check the rates on your website?



Please note that room rates and availability are subject to change at any time.
Agoda cannot provide you with a quoted rate because of this variation.
You can get the most up-to-date rates and availability by going to the website and completing your travel information.





How can I get 1 night free when booking a room with "Rates includes discount worth 1 night" promotion?



All promotional rates displayed are already discounted. If free nights are included in the booking, you will receive a discount worth the specified amount of nights. You will not get more free nights in addition to what you book on the website. Information regarding specific hotel promotions are also displayed on the booking form.  For more details, please continue to the booking form.





How can I see the room rate in a currency of my choice?



You can easily choose the currency of your choice by selecting it from the drop-down box found at the top of the page. The page will automatically update to reflect the selected currency.





How do I make a booking?



Please note that room rates and availability are subject to change at any time.
Agoda cannot provide you with a quoted rate because of this variation.
You can get the most up-to-date rates and availability by going to the website and completing your travel information.

IMPORTANT: Please note that the lead guest name is entered correctly.





How long does it take to check if a room is available?



Availability is based on your search criteria. If a hotel is displayed based on your search criteria, the available room types will be displayed.





How many rooms are available?



The number of rooms available for your period of stay is displayed on the hotel page after you enter in your travel requirements (dates & destination). 
If you wish to book more rooms than what are available, you will need to split into different room types or search for another hotel. Please note that we may not be able to confirm room availability for any additional rooms in any extra booking, as rooms can be taken at any time.





I have made a booking on the Agoda website but I have found a cheaper rate.



Agoda offers the following “Best Price Guarantee”. If you have reserved a hotel room through Agoda and then show us that you could book the same room for the same dates with the same conditions at a lower rate that is viewable and bookable on another website. We will either match that rate or beat it. Please click on the following link for further information :
http://www.agoda.com/info/agoda_policies.html#1





Is there an additional charge for children when sharing a room with their parents?



Most hotels allow children to stay in the room with parents either with or without an extra bed. The normal hotel policy is not to charge for children if they are under twelve years of age. Some hotels will limit occupancy of a room to two adults and one child. Only a few hotels will have existing bedding for additional children, so an extra bed is usually required. Most hotels will charge for this extra bed. Usually hotels will provide breakfast when there is a charge for an extra bed. However, this is dependent on each property's policies and procedures. A baby cot may be provided free of charge, by some hotels, for children under the age of 2.





l want to stay longer than 30 days/nights



If you require more than a 30-day stay, you need to make 2 separate bookings. For example, a 35 night stay would need to be broken out into 2 bookings, 1 for 30 days, the other for 5 days.





Travel Advisories and Other News



Events happen around the world and, occasionally, your travel destination may be affected by an unexpected occurrence. In addition, you should familiarize yourself with the country you are planning to visit, both in terms of customs and habits, but also about potential risks. For these reasons, agoda.com recommends its customers to monitor the news and consult with their respective Embassies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or other Government sources for official country-specific travel advisories.





What should I do if I would like to book more than 9 rooms?



You can reserve up to 9 rooms per booking on Agoda. If you need more rooms, please make an additional booking. Please note that rooms are subject to availability, and that some properties may have different policies or conditions that apply to bookings of 5 rooms or more.





When I check your website it shows no availability, does it mean that the hotel is fully booked?



Unfortunately there are no available rooms at your chosen Hotel for those dates. Please choose one of the following options: 
Go back to your chosen Hotel and change your search criteria
OR
Search for more available hotels in your chosen destination





Where can I find the cancellation policy?



When searching for the room rate, booking conditions will be right under the room type description. To check further, you can also click on the ""CLICK TO BOOK"" button which will direct you to the booking form. The cancellation policy/booking conditions link can be found in the middle of every page of the booking form. It will also be stated in the confirmation email we send you. If you cancel your booking via self service the cancellation policy will be shown again upon cancellation.

Note: Details and conditions in the cancellation policy will be different for each booking depending on the hotel, period of stay, room type etc. Please read this carefully before submitting your booking.





Why has the room rate changed?



Our hotel partners have the ability to change rates and promotions at any time. Market conditions, changes in strategy and availability are just a few reasons why you may experience this rate fluctuation.





Why isn't the current year being displayed in the dropdown menus for Check-in and Check-out dates?



The dates available for selection on our site are directly linked to the date and time set on your computer. Verify that your computer is set to the current date and time.

Click the Start menu, select Settings ? Control Panel. Within the Control Panel window, select the Date and Time icon in order to open the Date and Time Properties window.

In the Date and Time Properties window, select the Date & Time tab to view the current settings. Check to see that the correct month, year, day, hour, and time zone are being displayed. If these properties are not up to date, you must change them in order to see the current year within the dropdown menus of the Check-in and Check-out dates on the Agoda site. To change to the current time zone, first select the Time Zone tab then click on the dropdown arrow, select the correct time zone from the list, and click on the apply button.





What is "Book Now Pay Later"?



Book Now Pay Later is just that, make a booking now, pay for it later.
As with all Agoda.com bookings, it is confirmed instantly.  Approximately 2-3 days prior to the booking conditions becoming active, your credit card will be billed for the full amount.  Simple.
If the room can be booked now and paid later, the text "Book now and pay nothing until (date, month and year)" will be displayed underneath the room image.  Please make sure you select "Pay Later" when you input your credit card details.
Book Now Pay Later conditions are based on the hotel cancellation policy, check in date and the room availability.  If you do not see this text on the room page it is not an avialable payment option.





Why don’t I see Book Now Pay Later rates on all hotels?



Book Now Pay Later conditions are based on the hotel cancellation policy, check in date and the room availability. If you do not see it when you search then it is not available for that hotel under that period of stay.





Where does a property's star rating come from?



Star ratings are declared by the properties, in accordance with regulatory oversight for their own markets. Agoda does not assign these ratings and accepts no liability for their accuracy.









Payments and refunds





How do I get a local tax receipt?



Local tax receipts are only available from properties for bookings where payments are made at the property.

For pre-paid bookings (pay Agoda), we can issue local invoices for bookings in Singapore since Agoda is a tax resident of Singapore and also Agoda receipts for anywhere else.





How do I get a receipt?



If you wish to get a receipt, please use agoda.com Self Service. Please note that we only offer an electronic receipt in PDF format.
Self service allows you to get your receipt under your company name & address. You can also action this request by logging on to 'manage my bookings' via the website.





Can I have a hard-copy receipt sent by post?



Please note that we only offer an electronic receipt in PDF format.





When will I get my refund?



Refunds, if applicable, will immediately be submitted to our bank. From the submission/refund date banks generally take up to 10 business days to process the refund payment and transfer the funds into a customers account. Please note, some banks can take up to 15-30 days, or until the next billing cycle. The refund should be converted to your local currency by your credit card company. How your reservation is processed will determine what shows on your card statement. However, your statement will ALWAYS show Agoda somewhere in the subject line.





How can I have the receipt under my company name and address?



If you wish to get a receipt, please use agoda.com Self Service. Please note that we only offer an electronic receipt in PDF format.

Self service allows you to get your receipt under your company name & address. You can also action this request by logging on to 'manage my bookings' via the website.





Can I make a booking using my friends credit card?



Yes. Please note that we may contact you for security purposes when making a 3rd party booking.





Do you charge my credit card immediately upon confirmation?



1)
Rate per room per night - Pay online:
If a room is available and you've submitted your credit card details and agreed to the booking conditions on the booking form, the reservation is then confirmed and a hotel voucher will be automatically sent to your e-mail address. The hotel voucher is only issued after we have verified and charged your credit card. The hotel voucher AND credit card must be presented upon check-in at the hotel, together with a valid form of photo ID.
2)
Book Now Pay Later - Pay online:
Book Now Pay Later is just that, make a booking now, pay for it later.  The booking will be instantly confirmed.  The booking conditions (cancellation policy) will determine when you are billed.  The actual charge date will be approximately 2-3 days prior to the hotel booking conditions becoming active.  At that time you will be charged the full amount.  This option is only available for Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and JCB. Please make sure you select "Pay Later" when you input your credit card details.
3)
Special Rates - Pay at the hotel:
Agoda.com works in partnership with other companies to ensure we offer the best rates. If you choose to stay at a hotel where an agoda.com partner has provided the lowest rate, we will confirm your reservation and issue a confirmation email. In such cases we will not charge your card. You will be required to pay the hotel directly upon check-out and the hotels own cancellation policy will apply. The title of the rate section for these hotels is 'Special Rates' instead of 'Rate per room per night'.
Please note: Some hotels may charge your credit card with the full amount upon confirmation. This is mostly the case for non refundable bookings.





Does the hotel need a deposit or a payment in advance?



That depends on the type of booking:
1)
Rate per room per night - Pay online:
If a room is available and you've submitted your credit card details and agreed to the booking conditions on the booking form, the reservation is then confirmed and a hotel voucher will be automatically sent to your e-mail address. The hotel voucher is only issued after we have verified and charged your credit card. The hotel voucher AND credit card must be presented upon check-in at the hotel, together with a valid form of photo ID.

The actual charge date will be approximately 2-3 days prior to the hotel booking conditions becoming active.  At that time you will be charged the full amount.

If you choose to stay at a hotel where an agoda.com partner has provided the lowest rate, we will confirm your reservation and issue a confirmation email. In such cases we will not charge your card. You will be required to pay the hotel directly upon check-out and the hotels own cancellation policy will apply. The title of the rate section for these hotels is 'Special Rates' instead of 'Rate per room per night'.
Please note: The hotel reserves the right to preauthorize/charge your credit card prior to arrival. Timing and amount of charges will be in line with the conditions of your booking.





I have already made my booking. Can I change the currency used?



Unfortunately we cannot change the currency selected once the payment has been made. Please ensure that the currency chosen is correct before proceeding with your reservation.





I will not be going anymore. Can my friend use the booking?



Should you need to change the name of the reservation you must contact agoda.com as soon as possible. If you do not contact us to change the guest name the hotel reserves the right to refuse check in.





Is it safe to enter my credit card details?



Agoda.com uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all information. To check our site's authenticity and to verify the validity of our secured communication and information exchange lines, please click https://sealinfo.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&dn;=RESERVATION.AGODA.COM&en;

Your credit card will be charged by Agoda Company Pte Ltd, the company managing all credit card transactions for Agoda Travel Network companies including www.agoda.com. If you have any questions regarding charges to your credit card, please contact our Agoda Support Center.





Should I speak to my bank before I make a booking?



In general there should be no need to speak to your bank before making a booking. However, if you are making a booking from a different country then your bank may block your payment for your security. If you are using your card outside of your home country it may be advisable to let them know to prevent any inconvenience.





The hotel has charged my credit card.



Unless specified, the Hotel should not charge your card.  If this happens, either a) call us immediately or b) send an email to CustomerService@agoda.com.  We will open an investigation immediately.





What do I do if my credit card shows a slightly different charge than what is shown on my receipt?



The difference is a fee your bank has imposed on the transaction. The global financial crisis, in combination with recent legislation in the US has put significant pressure on the profitability of the banking and credit card industries. As a consequence, many banks have drastically increased the fees associated with international transactions in an attempt to recoup losses in other areas. This dubious business practice is unfortunately completely out of our control. If this happens to you, please let us know and we will do everything we can to help you recoup these fees with the bank.





Can I pay for the Book Now Pay Later bookings whenever I want?



No, we cannot change the payment option  once the booking is confirmed. 
Please make sure you select "Pay Later" when you input your credit card details.





Why was my card authorized for 1 USD for Book Now Pay Later?



For Book Now Pay Later, the 1 USD is pre-authorized to make sure your credit card is valid. Please note that this is not an additional fee.





Why can’t I use PayPal or Alipay for Book Now Pay Later?



Please note that Book Now Pay Later rates are only available for credit card payment type.





I have a Book Now Pay Later booking. Why do I need to pay before my charge date?



We will only ask to charge your credit card before the charge date because of 3 scenarios:
1) You are asking to change your check in date in which your credit card will expire before that new check in date.
2) You are asking to change your booking and the hotel policy changes to be non-refundable.
3) You are asking to change your check in date to be earlier in which the charge date also becomes earlier.





I don’t have a credit card. Can I pay by another method?



Yes! Agoda offers travelers multiple convenient ways to pay, including PayPal, debit card, bank transfer, online bank transfer, or even ATM and local counter payments in some countries. Many of our hotels, villas, and apartments even let you pay in person upon check-in. These payment methods are subject to availability, and will appear as options on your booking form.





When do I pay for my booking?



That depends on the type of booking:
1)
Rate per room per night - Pay online:
If a room is available and you've submitted your credit card details and agreed to the booking conditions on the booking form, the reservation is then confirmed and a hotel voucher will be automatically sent to your e-mail address.

What are the charges for taxes & services?



In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the charge to your credit card will include a charge for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.

Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.

For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.

Problem with Credit Card Charge / Currency



The charge that appears on your statement will be converted to your local currency by your credit card company. 

The difference is a fee your bank has imposed on the transaction. The global financial crisis, in combination with recent legislation in the US has put significant pressure on the profitability of the banking and credit card industries. As a consequence, many banks have drastically increased the fees associated with international transactions in an attempt to recoup losses in other areas. This dubious business practice is unfortunately completely out of our control.





Problem with Cancellation Fee



The details and conditions of the cancellation policy will be different for each booking depending on the hotel, period of stay, room type, promotion, etc. 

When searching for the room rate, booking conditions will be right under the room type description. To check these please hover over ‘Free Cancellation?’ You can also click on the ""BOOK IT"" button which will direct you to the booking form.

Breakfast availability is determined by the hotel. If you would like to inquire as to whether breakfast is available, we recommend that you contact the hotel upon check in.

The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.

Redemption is incredibly easy: Just use your Gift Cards on eligible bookings! No minimums, no tiers, no problem. Just be sure you’re logged in when booking your room.





Why do Gift Card amounts vary by booking?



Our goal is to maximize the rewards for all Agoda members. Rewards are calculated on a number of factors. We reward our most loyal customers with best benefits possible, so Gift Card amounts will generally rise with more bookings.





How can I earn more Gift Cards?



Travel! Members who book more often will earn a larger Gift Card for each booking.





How come I am unable to redeem Gift Cards on some rooms?



You can redeem up to the full booking value on most rooms in our 1,000,000+ properties worldwide. Just look for the Agoda Gift Card message when booking.
Some properties are not eligible for Gift Cards redemption. However, booking these rooms can still earn more Gift Cards for future use.









Refer a Friend





How do I earn a referral Gift Card from Agoda?



You can simply go to the Refer-a-Friend tab in your account and enter your friends’ email addresses. When a friend clicks the link in the email, they will receive a 5% coupon code for their first promo-eligible booking. When your friend completes their first booking, you will receive the same amount of referral credits in the form of an Agoda Gift Card that can be used on your own Agoda bookings. You will receive your Gift Card about 7 days after your friend has checked out. You can earn a maximum of $100 USD in referral Gift Cards.





Can I track how much I have earned through Refer-a-Friend?



Certainly! Simply sign in to your Agoda account and go to your tracking dashboard on the Refer-a-Friend tab.





When can I use my referral Gift Cards?



You will earn referral credits in the form of an Agoda Gift Card about 7 days after your friend has checked out from their first booking. Once the Gift Card is issued, redemption is incredibly easy – just use your Gift Card on eligible bookings. No minimums, no tiers, no problems. Just make sure to sign in when booking your room. Gift Cards expire 90 days from the date of issuance.





How can I join Refer-a-Friend program?



The program is currently invite only – we will be opening it to all users soon. Stay tuned!
