Agoda Terms of Use

Last updated November 2017

Agoda welcomes you (the “Customer” or “you”) to its website (the “Site”). The terms "Agoda" or "we" refer to Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. and the term "Agoda Companies" collectively refers to Agoda and relevant Agoda’s affiliates, including but not necessarily limited to Agoda Services Co., Ltd. (Thailand), Agoda International Pte. Ltd. (Singapore, the UK establishment and other local branches), Agoda International Travel Operations Pte. Ltd., Agoda International (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., Agoda International (Hong Kong) Ltd., Agoda International Hungary Kft., Agoda International Japan KK, Agoda International USA Inc.,  etc.. References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to websites and applications, whether accessed by mobile phone, tablet or other device. The Terms of Use –as defined below- apply to our services, directly or indirectly made available to you through whatever means, including online reservations, customer service requests or otherwise. By accessing, browsing and using the Site and/or by making a reservation through Agoda, you acknowledge and agree having read, understood and agreed to the Terms of Use. Our different policies and guidelines, which can be found throughout the Site, including but not limited to, the
Privacy Policy
,
Shop Safe Policy
,
Agoda Price Guarantee
,
Reservation Guarantee
,
Cancellation Policy
,

, etc. (collectively the “Policies”), should be read in conjunction with and are an integral part of these terms and conditions and are hereby included by reference. The terms and conditions set out below and the Policies are collectively referred to as the “Terms of Use”. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please cease use of the Site immediately. The Terms of Use – as may be amended from time to time – constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between you and the Agoda Companies with respect to their subject matters unless explicitly stated otherwise.

1. Scope of our Services

A. Accommodation Reservation

Through the Site, Agoda provides an online platform through which you can browse different types of lodging and temporary accommodation, including but not necessarily limited to hotels, hostels, serviced apartments, B&Bs;, rooms for rent, cottages, ryokans, etc. (collectively, the “Accommodation(s)”) and make reservations with such Accommodations. By making a booking through the Site, you make an offer to book a reservation at the price listed for such reservation and such other terms and conditions stated on the Site. This shall become a binding contract formed in Singapore pursuant to the Terms of Use when accepted by the Accommodation and consequently Agoda. You will receive proof of the confirmed Accommodation booking  via an e-mail confirmation (with a voucher for prepaid Accommodations),which means the reservation has been confirmed by the Accommodation. The  “thank you page” means your reservation request has been received and is  complete for final processing, no further action is required by you. We reserve the right to reject bookings as set out below.

When rendering our services, the information that we disclose about Accommodations is based on the information provided to us by our suppliers or providers (including but not necessarily limited to the Accommodations, their representatives, distributors, destination management companies (DMCs), channel managers, partners, etc.). As such, the Accommodations or their representatives are given access to an extranet or other connectivity solution through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability, description, pictures, booking conditions, accommodation policies and other information which is displayed on the Site. Although we will use commercially reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct or up to date, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of the Site or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each Accommodation remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the Accommodation information displayed on the Site. Changes in market conditions or circumstances may occur on short notice which may make information displayed on the Site inaccurate or outdated. In case of problems, our Customer Service will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist you and serve as a point of contact with the Accommodation. Please note that Agoda is one of many channels Accommodations use to make their inventory available for reservation. When a search result indicates that a particular Accommodation has no more rooms available, that means the room type is not available for reservation through Agoda.

The Site does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of (the quality, service level or rating of) any Accommodation listed on the Site. We hereby expressly disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality, status or adequacy of any Accommodation listed on the Site. The Accommodations can be ranked on the Site according to different criteria (star rating, reviews, etc.). The default ranking is based on an automated algorithm which may be updated or amended from time to time. Under certain circumstances, Agoda may also offer Accommodations the option to get a sponsored listing, i.e. to pay for a top spot. Such sponsored listing will be marked or contain wording for clarity.

We reserve the right not to accept customers or bookings (or in exceptional cases to cancel confirmed ones) at our discretion and for whatever (legal) reason without the need to justify such refusal. Typical reasons for rejecting a customer or booking include, but are not limited to: Accommodation request(s), reselling of Accommodations booked through the Site on an individual or mass basis without our prior written approval (“Reselling”), breach of the Terms of Use, force majeure events, trade or economic sanctions, embargoes, legal restrictions, (suspicions of) fraud or theft, suspected criminal activity, suspicious bookings, submission by customer of misleading or erroneous information, credit card problems, inappropriate behavior, threats, insults, violence, refusal to supply information, practical obstacles, communication problems, obvious errors (see below), history, blacklisting by governments or international organizations (USA, EU, UN, Singapore), etc. In case a booking is rejected or cancelled by Agoda and a payment has already been made, you will receive a refund of the total booking value, except in the case of unauthorized Reselling or in any other appropriate case that we determine in our sole and absolute discretion where we reserve the right not to refund the total booking value or any part thereof. Refunds will not be issued in the event of unauthorized Reselling due to many negative factors including the disadvantage such practice imposes on our authorized and contracted affiliate partners, Accommodations who provide Agoda with inventory on a contracted and trusted basis and the loss and negative brand impact caused to Agoda due to unauthorized Resellers attempting to undercut Agoda’s business which may include placing the resold inventory on sites run by competitors of Agoda without our knowledge. We also reserve the right to bar (“blacklist”) users from the Site, on a permanent or temporary basis, at our discretion. Any such blacklisted user must not attempt to use the Site under any other name or through any other user. See also below for our fraud prevention mechanisms.

In  rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a booking or make adjustments due to “obvious errors”, independent of the origin of such errors. For clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Site (e.g. in terms of price, conditions, points) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal. The booking or awarded points will be adjusted, or, where relevant, the amount charged will be reimbursed without charge in such cases. Whether to cancel or reject a booking for this reason is in Agoda’s sole discretion.

Please note that suspected group bookings can also be rejected or cancelled by Agoda or the Accommodation as most Accommodations have specific procedures for group bookings. Contact our
Customer Service team
for more information.

Circumstances such as ongoing renovations, Accommodation booking errors, and specific guest needs can affect the quality of your stay. Be sure to let the Accommodation know any special requests or requirements you have at check-in.

A word about star ratings

The Accommodation star ratings are provided for your information only. The star ratings are based on information we have received from our suppliers, including the Accommodations. We do not independently verify star ratings. A star rating is only indicative of the level of comfort you can expect to find in a particular Accommodation, with a higher star rating generally being indicative of a higher level of comfort and amenities. For more detailed information, please check the detailed description on the Site. Please be aware that star ratings can vary greatly on the basis of location, available alternatives, local market conditions, practices or other circumstances. Thus, it is possible that a star rating in one particular country or city is not comparable to the same star rating in another country or city due to such circumstances. Star ratings do not necessarily reflect all the amenities or services that might be available at an Accommodation, and some amenities and features may not be available in every room or at every property with a particular star rating. If there are particular amenities or features that are important to you, please contact our Customer Service and inquire as to the availability of such amenities or features.

B. Other Ancillary Services

Agoda provides an online platform through which you can browse other services, including but not necessarily limited to flights and rental cars, (“Ancillary Services”) and make reservations for such Ancillary Services. Although the Agoda Site provides the platform for which you can browse and make reservations for these Ancillary Services, the Ancillary Services are provided by Agoda associated companies or partners (“Partners”), which have been carefully selected by Agoda.  For example, flight display, search and reservation services on the Agoda Site are provided by KAYAK and its respective suppliers.  Such Partners will be clearly displayed on the Site when browsing the Ancillary Services and a link provided to the Partner’s terms and conditions of use and/or privacy policy, which will govern the relationship between you and our Partner for the relevant Ancillary Service reservation.

By making a booking through the Site for the Ancillary Services, you make an offer to book a reservation (e.g. for flights or a rental car) at the price listed for such reservation on the Site, and on such other terms and conditions notified to you by the Partner from time to time, which shall become a binding contract when your reservation is accepted by the Partner.  The Partner will indicate the acceptance of your Ancillary Service booking via an e-mail confirmation to you.  The Partner reserves the right to reject bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.

2. Use of the Site

As stated above, these Term of Use form an agreement between you and Agoda Companies. Agoda also works with other companies, including but not limited to Booking.com B.V., to offer reservations options in Accommodations worldwide to guests. In some cases, you will receive a confirmation referring to such other companies. Agoda may also offer the option to book Ancillary Services (flights, rental cars) in cooperation with selected Partners as described above.

Agoda grants you a limited, restricted, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable license to access and use the Site only as expressly permitted in the Terms of Use. Except for this limited license, we do not grant you any other rights or license with respect to the Site; any rights or licenses not expressly granted herein are reserved.

3. Prices, Additional Charges and Agoda Price Guarantee

A. Prices and Best Price Guarantee for Accommodations

We strive to have the most competitive prices and we want you to pay the lowest price possible for your stay at an Accommodation. Should you find your Accommodation room reservation, with the same booking conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a booking through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the Best Price Guarantee. For a claim to be valid under this guarantee, it must satisfy and be submitted in compliance with all relevant terms and conditions of our
Best Price Guarantee.


Sometimes cheaper rates are available on the Site for a specific stay at an Accommodation for the same room type, however, these rates made by Accommodations may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the room type and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. The same room type may have different rates, depending on such restrictions and conditions (see also section 6 below). For the avoidance of doubt, the Best Price Guarantee does not apply to Ancillary Services provided on the Site.

B. Additional Charges by Accommodations

Please note that all prices on the Site are for your Accommodation room reservation only and are for the requested stay dates and for the number of people indicated, unless indicated otherwise. The Accommodation room reservations rates are displayed per room and per night. Except where indicated otherwise, Agoda will typically display the rate exclusive of tax recovery and service charges (see below for more details) on the Site, and display these additional tax recovery and service charges during the booking path. Without prejudice to what is set out below, you will see the total inclusive price prior to confirming your booking. Display settings may vary, but this will at the latest show on the final booking page (before the confirmation screen). Please verify every step of your reservation on the booking form; you can discontinue the booking at any time prior to the final confirmation screen (please see below for post-booking cancellations). What is included in the rate is displayed on the Site (under the Accommodation information section or prior to the final booking confirmation) and/or in the confirmation email/voucher. Breakfast is typically not included unless explicitly stated otherwise. Hotel resort and other mandatory fees (see below) and certain local city, tourist or occupancy taxes (when applicable) that are required to be collected directly from guests, are typically not included in the rate unless stated otherwise. Please verify the Accommodation description or policies on the Site. Insurance of any kind is never included in the rates. The standard Accommodation room reservations are for single or double occupancy, extra beds will usually incur extra charges. The Accommodation may also refuse to accept additional persons if not duly informed in advance. Please note that certain Accommodations may charge you a so-called additional but mandatory “resort fee” (or similar) for the use of certain of their services. This resort fee is typically not included in the price, but it will be mentioned in the Accommodation description on the Site. You may also be charged directly by the Accommodation for energy surcharges, baggage handling fees, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees. The practice to add additional Accommodation fees is outside Agoda’s control and occurs in certain markets, including the USA. Needless to say, optional incidental fees and personal consumptions are almost never included, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service, food & beverage, gala dinners, movie rentals, internet, etc..  During certain high season periods, certain Accommodations will add on a compulsory gala dinner (e.g. for New Year, Christmas, Chinese New Year,etc.). This is not included in the room rate, but will be displayed on the booking form. Please check the “Accommodation Information”, “Booking Conditions”, “Cancellation Policy” or similar wording on the Site. When in doubt whether something is included, you can contact our Customer Service team.

For certain Accommodations, a compulsory transportation or transfer fee will be charged on top of the room rate at the request of the Accommodation, or at your option where available. This is especially common for island destinations (e.g. the Maldives) where you need Accommodation transportation to reach the Accommodation. Please note that Agoda does not organize any Accommodation transportation, this is always organized by and offered by or on behalf of the Accommodation, who is responsible for such transportation services, not Agoda. Agoda does not assume any liability for the quality, safety, frequency or service levels of such transportation services. In some jurisdictions, the Accommodations are also required to directly collect a local bed or city tax from the guests. Governments have on occasion issued additional taxes and may ask the Accommodations to collect these directly. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the Accommodation directly at checkout. Please verify with the Accommodation or
Customer Service
which extra fees are (not) included.

C. Additional Charges for Ancillary Services

Please note that all prices on the Site are for Ancillary Services are set by our Partners, unless otherwise indicated. Please refer to the appropriate Partner’s terms and conditions for any additional charges that may be applicable to your reservation (for example, airport tax).

D. Currency Conversion

Rates can be converted into different currencies for your convenience. Accommodation and Ancillary Service rates provided in a currency other than the currency displayed on the Site are converted to the displayed currency at a rate determined by Agoda, which may include a conversion and/or processing fee for certain currencies.  The currency and amount you see displayed at the latest on the final booking page is the amount Agoda Companies will charge to your credit card. You may be given the option to pay in your credit card currency if it is different from the selected currency. In case of immediate payment, you will see the converted amount that will be charged to your card. In case of “Book Now, Pay Later” (see Section 5), you will see an estimate of the converted amount, which will only be charged at the exchange rate of the future payment date, meaning it could be different from the estimate. Your bank may impose additional fees on the transaction, over which Agoda Companies have no control. Please note that exchange rates fluctuate daily. For customers using Alipay or UnionPay for payment, please note that all charges will always be made in Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY/RMB) (amount as displayed) and that the USD amount displayed between brackets is for reference only. Certain credit cards do not accept payments in certain currencies, in which case an alternative currency (typically based on the country of the issuing bank) will be proposed in a new field. Please pay attention to the booking form fields prior to clicking the confirmation button.

A Word on Charges for Taxes and Fees

In connection with facilitating your Accommodation transaction, the charge to your credit card may include a charge for taxes and fees (“Taxes and Fees”) unless indicated otherwise. In relation to Accommodations, this charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount Agoda Companies pay to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the Accommodation including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the Accommodation. The amount paid to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount Agoda Companies estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee Agoda Companies retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. If the balance is negative, Agoda Companies will absorb such difference. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount Agoda Companies pay the Accommodation and the location of the Accommodation where you will be staying, and may include profit that Agoda Companies retain.

Except as described below, Agoda Companies are not the vendors collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our Accommodation suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed and Agoda Companies pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. Agoda Companies are not co-vendors associated with the vendors with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.

For transactions involving Accommodations located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax that Agoda Companies are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts Agoda Companies retain as compensation for services.

For Accommodations where you need to pay at the Accommodation, the price may or may not include taxes and fees. Please verify the booking conditions and your confirmation mail or voucher or contact our Customer Service team.

As stated above, certain cities or municipalities charge city, bed, tourist occupancy or equivalent taxes that have to be collected by the Accommodation locally.

In relation to Ancillary Services, calculation of applicable taxes and fees will be set out in our Partner’s terms and conditions.

4. Privacy

We respect your privacy. Please have a look at our
Privacy Policy
for further information.

5. Payment - Credit Card – “Book Now, Pay Later” – Age - Fraud

For pre-paid Accommodation bookings with Agoda, your credit card will be charged by Agoda Companies for the full price (sometimes without any option for refund depending on the Accommodation’s booking conditions, see below) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking or, in case of a “Book Now, Pay Later” booking, at the future point in time communicated in the confirmation email. When using “Book Now, Pay Later”, please ensure that the credit card is valid and has sufficient credit on the future payment date. If the credit card cannot be charged on such date for whatever reason, the booking will be cancelled unless you can ensure that the card payment can be authorized on time. Please check the reservation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Agoda Companies will process refunds, if and when applicable, within a reasonable timeframe. For certain Accommodations, Agoda Companies will not charge your credit card, as you will pay the Accommodation directly for your stay (post-paid). However, in such cases some Accommodations may pre-authorize your card, charge a deposit or charge the full price of the reservation up-front. Accommodations may require credit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, Agoda Companies will send your credit card information directly to the Accommodation at which your booking is made and may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. In order to safeguard and encrypt your credit card information when in transit to us, we use the "Secure Socket Layer (SSL)" technology for our services. Please note that your bank may impose additional fees on the transaction, over which Agoda Companies have no control.

Certain credit card companies charge their member banks a fee for processing "foreign transactions". If you make card transactions and the recipient uses a bank located in a different country other than the bank which issued your card, an international service assessment, cross-border transaction fee or similar fee may be charged. Your issuing bank may or may not pass this fee on to you (the card user). Please contact your issuing bank for details as this is outside the control of Agoda Companies.

In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, you should contact your bank or card issuer immediately upon becoming aware of such unauthorized use. If you suspect an unauthorized or fraudulent booking was made via Agoda, please contact our Customer Service team immediately.

In order to make a booking you must be over 18 years old (or the age of majority in those countries and territories where it is higher than 18) and have the full legal capacity to make the transaction (or have the authorization from your legal guardian). You undertake that the credit or debit card you are using is your own or that you are authorized to complete the booking with this card and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the transaction. You accept financial responsibility for all transactions made under your name or account.

You undertake that the details you provide us with in making a booking are fully correct. Agoda Companies reserve the right not to accept certain credit cards. Agoda may add or remove other payment methods at its discretion. For increased convenience, Agoda now also offers the option to have your credit card details securely stored on file. For more details, have a look at our Privacy Policy.

We have stringent fraud detection and prevention mechanisms in place. In certain cases, we may require additional information or verifications to validate and confirm the booking, as explained in more detail on the Site. A small verification charge or pre-authorization may also be made to your card, also when using "Book Now Pay Later". The balance will be charged after confirmation or, in case of "Book Now Pay Later", on the future payment date (see the comment above about the possibility of cancellation in case the card cannot be charged on that date for whatever reason). Reservations are not confirmed until you have received a confirmation mail with a voucher and it is possible that an Accommodation could become fully booked during the fraud check, in which case the reservation will no longer be available. Agoda can never be held liable in such cases. Additional information submitted will be treated in line with strict industry standards to protect privacy, using encryption for transmission and specialized agents for verification. If you choose not to submit the additional information or if we are not satisfied with the information received, the booking will not be completed and fully cancelled and any amounts charged (including the verification charge where applicable) will be refunded.

A word about failed payments

For a variety of reasons, payment on the Site may fail. In such cases, Agoda will offer you alternatives to ensure your reservation can go ahead. If you have any questions, please contact our Customer Service department.

6. Booking conditions - Cancellations, No-Shows, Early Departure and Late Check-Out – Specific Accommodation Policies - Special Needs – additional Agoda services or products

By making an Accommodation reservation on our Site, you accept and agree to the relevant Accommodation booking conditions, including cancellation and no-show policies applicable to that booking, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Accommodation that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Accommodation (the delivery terms and conditions of an Accommodation can be obtained with the relevant Accommodation). The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Accommodation is made available on the Site at the Accommodation information pages or under “Booking Conditions”, “Cancellation Policies” or the like, and in the confirmation email and voucher. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the Accommodation’s cancellation and no-show policy, in some cases for the entire stay or the first night. We recommend that you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the Accommodation carefully prior to making your reservation. If you fail to check in to your Accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not alert the Accommodation, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable Accommodation. Regardless of the Accommodation’s cancellation policy, Agoda Companies reserve the right to charge a cancellation fee, this will be indicated on the Site. Please carefully check the Accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Some Accommodations will charge extra for early or late check-outs.

If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein, use our self-service tool or contact Customer Service.

Many Accommodations have specific policies around children, accompanying travelers and/or traveling with pets. As indicated above, you are strongly advised to check with Customer Service, the Accommodation itself or to verify the Accommodation policies.

Special Needs: If you have special needs (e.g., wheelchair accessible room) you must contact Customer Service or the Accommodation and verify that special needs can be met. Please note that all special requests are subject to availability and cannot be guaranteed by Agoda. Depending on the policy of the applicable Accommodation, your reservation will be refunded, canceled or modified if special needs cannot be met. If available, your request will be confirmed upon arrival.


A word about Agoda Price Alerts

You may elect to set Agoda “Price Alerts” on Accommodations found on our Site. If elected, we will send you a Price Alert when prices at your selected Accommodation(s) and for the indicated time frame on our Site change. Price Alerts will not be specific to a type of room or other features relating to an Accommodation (e.g. breakfast included, full board, type of bed). A maximum of one Price Alert per Accommodation per day will be sent to you. Sending a Price Alert will only be triggered if the Accommodation price changes beyond a "materiality" threshold we set. The type of Price Alert sent to you will depend on the medium you use, that is by email if your chosen Site is the Agoda website or by push notification if your chosen Site is our Agoda app. You are responsible for updating your Price Alert settings. Price Alerts within your settings will continue to be sent to you even if you make a booking for the selected Accommodation or another Accommodation for the indicated time period until you change your Price Alert settings. Opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us.  Additionally, we will of course provide you with the ability to opt out of receiving Price Alerts at any time by clicking on the “turn off price alerts” or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you. For more information on this, please see our Privacy Policy.

A word about Agoda’s Secret Deals

Through its “Secret Deals” program, Agoda is frequently able to offer quality Accommodation rooms at very attractive rates, which means you can enjoy great savings on quality accommodation at selected properties worldwide, from luxurious five-star to charming boutique hotels. For various reasons, the Accommodations participating in this program prefer to stay anonymous until the booking is confirmed and paid.

Secret Deals are indicated with a specific logo and you can browse and consult key information about these properties (general area, description, facilities) prior to making a reservation, but you will not know which property it is. Upon completion of your reservation, the property name, location and contact details will be revealed. To ensure that Agoda can continue to offer these special rates on a regular basis, Secret Deal bookings are non-cancellable and non-refundable.

A word about PointsMAX

Through its “PointsMAX” program, Agoda is offering you the opportunity to collect points with certain third party loyalty programs (e.g. miles programs from airlines). For certain Accommodations, you will be able to select a third party loyalty program from the PointsMAX menu to view offers, next to our usual room offering. If available, you will be offered the choice of a PointsMAX booking that will incur points with your selected third party loyalty program. The points you are earning and the program name are reconfirmed on your booking form and the thank you confirmation message you will receive after making a PointsMAX booking. Points will be posted directly on your third-party program account within 2 to 8 weeks after your check-out date. For the avoidance of doubt, the PointsMAX program does not apply to Ancillary Services provided on the Site.

Some important notes on all PointsMAX bookings:


The membership ID of the intended beneficiary of the third party points must belong to the guest staying at the hotel (identified by the lead guest name);

The rates for PointsMAX bookings may be different from regular bookings at the same conditions;

PointsMAX booking rates cannot be broken down into a room rate and points component;

Any applicable cancellation policy will apply in full to the PointsMAX bookings;

Only reward points or miles can be collected, not status points or points;

Cancelled reservations will not earn points, regardless of the financial cancellations conditions;

Points cannot be exchanged in cash and are not cumulative with other offers;

The Agoda price guarantee does not apply to PointsMAX bookings; and

The terms and conditions of the third party loyalty programs will apply to such program.


A word about Agoda Reception

Available at selected properties only, Agoda may enroll you in its  “Agoda Reception” program, where through the Agoda App you will be able to view  a list of your charges, checkout (if the relevant property allows) and receive  notifications relevant to, and through the course of your stay at a property  booked through Agoda. You will be notified of enrollment into the Agoda  Reception program on the Agoda booking confirmation for the relevant property.  Initially, enrollment into the Agoda Reception program will be free of charge  and you will able to opt out of the Agoda Reception program at designated  point(s) of your stay. Charges incurred at the property during your stay and  that you will be able to view via Agoda Reception may include room service, spa  treatments, restaurant/(mini)bar, extra beds, extra stays, telephone, internet,  pay-per-view, business center and other charges that you may incur during your  stay. Such charges can be viewed via Agoda Reception and will be updated as you  progress in your stay. All charges viewable via Agoda Reception are charges  incurred at, charged by, and payable to the relevant property and no charges  viewable via Agoda Reception will be payable to Agoda. Further, at the end of  your stay, you will be able to view a list of charges incurred at the property  that you will be able to email to your designated email address. Please note  that the list of charges generated on Agoda Reception is not, and cannot be  construed as a tax invoice – the relevant tax invoice can only be issued by the  relevant property directly. Charges will in most cases, be charged to your  credit card of choice either to the credit card that you may have on file with  Agoda when you made the booking through Agoda,   or the credit card that you may supply to the relevant property when you  check in or check out. For more information about the limited and secure  sharing of your credit card data by Agoda to the relevant property booked by  you, please see our Privacy Policy.

Any disputes or issues that you may have on the charges viewable via  Agoda Reception must be taken up by you with the relevant property directly and  Agoda disclaims any risk or responsibility for such charges incurred by you  with the relevant property. In using and being enrolled in the Agoda Reception  program, Agoda makes no warranties or representations of any kind including but  not limited to merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular use,  nor does Agoda warrant or represent that the Agoda Reception program is or will  be always available, accurate, reliable or free of any defects. By  participating in the Agoda Reception program, you participate at your own risk.

8. Reviews – Further correspondence - Rights to User Content – Other services

By completing a booking, you agree to receive confirmation messages (email and/or SMS), as well as an invitation email to complete our guest review form which we will promptly send to you after your stay at the Accommodation, followed by one or more reminders. Completion is optional. For clarity, the confirmation and guest review communications  (emails, SMS) are transactional and are not part of the newsletters or marketing mails, from which you can unsubscribe (see our Privacy Policy for more details).  For Ancillary Services, the Partner providing the Ancillary Service may invite you to complete a review regarding the Ancillary Services provided.  The completed guest review (including attachments, if any) may be uploaded onto the relevant information page on the Site for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the Accommodation.

9. Travel advisory – Visa requirements

Although most travel is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. We urge passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their governments prior to booking travel, particularly when travelling to international destinations.

By displaying Accommodations in particular destinations, Agoda does not represent or warrant that travel to such points is advisable or risk-free and Agoda can never be held liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations. Agoda can under no circumstances be held liable for any incidents occurring during your stay at the Accommodation. You are strongly advised to check the relevant travel advisories issued by your government for any country you are visiting and to take the necessary precautions. You are also advised to take personal travel insurance.

Agoda cannot be held liable for any loss incurred in the event of your failure to hold the necessary passports, visas and documentation for your journey. You are advised to check with the relevant embassies, consulates and/or visa departments of the countries you wish to visit. It is your responsibility to obtain whatever travel documents are required.

Please note that some countries have strict rules and regulations on the import of restricted or prohibited goods, items or substances. These can include but are not necessarily limited to alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, drugs, medication, books, movies, DVDs, adult entertainment materials, food stuffs, plants, animal parts, etc. It is your responsibility to verify and comply with applicable regulations. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties.

10. Complaints

If you have complaints about Agoda’s service, you can contact our
Customer Service team
via one of the methods described
here
. We will do our very best to help you. Please note that any complaints about the Accommodation (policies, standards, service, facilities, decoration, food, etc.) is ultimately a matter for the Accommodation itself. Agoda will coordinate  directly with the Accommodation to try and find a mutually agreeable solution but cannot guarantee a satisfactory outcome. Complaints about Ancillary Services are governed by the terms and conditions of the Partner providing the Ancillary Service.

Agoda Companies do not guarantee continuous access without interruption to the Site.

Agoda will bear the responsibility required by relevant laws only if it is at fault for engaging in intentional or willful misconduct or it is grossly negligent in providing the relevant service. To the extent permissible pursuant to the relevant applicable laws, and without prejudice to the limitations set out in the Terms of Use, the liability of Agoda Companies, in the aggregate, will not exceed the lesser of (a) the aggregate cost of your reservation as set out in the confirmation email (whether for one event or series of connected events) or (b) two hundred and fifty United States dollars (or its equivalent in local currency).  In case of an overcharge or mischarge caused by Agoda, the customer can make a claim regarding all erroneous charges notwithstanding what is set out above.

In such case, Agoda shall bear the liability to the extent set forth in the relevant laws. Claims should be submitted as soon as possible after occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. Claims submitted with undue delay may be considered void pursuant to applicable statute of limitations. Only bona fide claims will be considered.

Miscellaneous

Agoda Companies do not in any way (directly or indirectly, independently or in conjunction with any party) own, manage, operate or control the Accommodations, or any room in such Accommodations. The Accommodations are liable and responsible for providing accommodation services and welcoming people who have booked through the Site as their guests.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Agoda Companies from and against any liability, damage or loss including legal fees and expenses that Agoda Companies incur or suffer as a result of any action, inaction or omission by you. If you use the Site for or on behalf of a third-party ("Third-party"), such as a family member or a traveling companion, you are responsible for any error in the accuracy of information provided in connection with such use. In addition, you must inform the Third-party of all applicable terms and conditions. Each customer using the Site for or on behalf of a Third-party agrees to indemnify and hold each Agoda Company harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, suits and claims (including the costs of defense), relating to the Third-party's or the user's failure to fulfill any of its obligations as described above.

You are at all times bound by the local laws and regulations. Things which are legal in certain countries may be illegal in others. You should enquire about applicable restrictions. Agoda Companies cannot be held liable in case an Accommodation refuses to check you in or asks you to leave for legal or regulatory reasons.

For your convenience, the Site and the Terms of Use exist in a number of languages and local versions (identified  by different top level domain names in some cases), but have originally been drawn up in the English language. In case of conflict between the English language version and a translated version, the English language version of the Terms of Use shall prevail.

The Terms of Use shall be deemed severable. In the event that any provision is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. The severed provisions shall be replaced by a provision approximating as much as possible the original wording and intent.

Agoda reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to the extent permissible under relevant law to temporarily or permanently modify, suspend, or terminate the Site and/or any portion thereof, including any service or product available through the Site, and/or your use of the Site, or any portion thereof. In the event of termination of the Site, the reservations made via Agoda will still be honored unless you receive a notification. You will still be bound by your obligations under the Terms of Use, including the warranties made by you, and by the disclaimers and limitations of liability. Additionally, Agoda shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Site. Agoda reserves the right to amend or repeal the Terms of Use (or parts thereof) as it deems appropriate. Accommodations have the right to change their offerings and this is outside Agoda’s control.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Terms of Use do not apply to commercial contractual relationships Agoda Companies may have with others, including but not limited to the Accommodations and certain marketing partners.

Local tax receipts are only available from properties for bookings where payments are made at the property. For pre-paid bookings (pay Agoda), Agoda Companies can issue local invoices for bookings in Singapore since Agoda is a tax resident of Singapore and also Agoda receipts for anywhere else.

The Terms of Use and the provision of our services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore without reference to Singapore conflict of laws rules, and any dispute arising out of the Terms of Use and the services of Agoda Companies shall exclusively be submitted to the competent courts in Singapore. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001 (Cap. 53B) is expressly excluded and shall not apply to the Terms of Use.

Failure by Agoda Companies to enforce a right does not result in waiver of such right. You may not assign or transfer your rights. We may amend the Terms of Use at any time by posting a variation on the Site. The latest version of the Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions.
