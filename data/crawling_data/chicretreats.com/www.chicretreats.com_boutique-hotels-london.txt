Mold-setting, boundary-breaking London is a cultural phenomenon. From Hampstead Heath’s tranquil parkland to the cooler-than-thou rooftops of Peckham, each of its boroughs holds on to a unique sense of style and proudly parades an international smorgasbord of culinary feats. Packed with iconic sights, world-renowned museums and designer talent, this capital
par excellence
is a world onto itself. Its charming boutique hotels are no less eclectic: from terraced Victorian boltholes to hip East End members’ rooms and Knightsbridge grand dames, each welcomes weary travellers home.
More about London.



When to go

There’s never a bad time to visit the capital, though the notoriously fickle British weather can dampen spirits in winter. High summer can be crowded with tourists, but the long daylight hours more than make up for it.

Food & Drink

It’s London – you can get almost any food you can imagine at any hour of the day. The capital’s lively markets draw local foodies every weekend; we love Borough Market’s riverside location and Broadway Market’s hipster vibe. For spectacular views try Searcys in the Gherkin or the Shard’s award-winning Hutong. St John led the vanguard in nose-to-tail eating: book early for masterful British classics.

Not to miss

Forgo breakfast in bed and head early to Columbia Road Flower Market on a Sunday morning for Instagram-worthy shots of the East End in bloom.



Nightlife

London’s legendary nightlife is as varied as its boroughs. Sashay the night away in iconic clubs Fabric and Ministry of Sound, or seek out intimate bars for cocktail-fuelled evenings. It may be tiny, but the Gibson rustles up some of the capital’s most spectacular tipples; Scarfe’s club-like digs are good for gin-soaked fun.

Where to stay in London

A stone’s throw from bustling shops and inviting restaurants, photogenic Notting Hill is London at its most romantic. Knightsbridge is packed with designer shops and handy for Hyde Park. Marylebone has high-end boutiques, artisanal foodie haunts and an appealing air of bygone elegance.

How to get there

London Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports are well-served by low-cost flights to Europe; Heathrow Airport is a major international hub with direct connections to the rest of the world. Hop on the Eurostar to reach Paris and Brussels in record time.
