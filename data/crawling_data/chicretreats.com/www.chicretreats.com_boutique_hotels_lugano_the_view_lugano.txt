Overview



Introduction

THE VIEW Lugano sits quietly and majestically on the hill of Paradiso overlooking the city and the Lake of Lugano. Not only has it introduced a brand new boutique hotel concept to the city of Lugano, but also to Europe: to enjoy the feeling of being on a luxury yacht in the middle of a city.
Surrounded by naval teak, used on the best luxury yachts, guests can admire the views whilst enjoying the sensation of being on a luxury cruise ship. A complete sensory experience has been put together by architect Luca Gazzaniga and interior design team Interior Haut Design.
This boutique hotel in Lugano is a design first and the contemporary suites, spa, and restaurant combine together to make THE VIEW Lugano the best luxury hotel in the city.
AWARDS
Switzerland's Leading Design Hotel - World Travel Awards 2015

Activities
The Saunas, Hammams, Jacuzzis, and Kneipp path allow guests to truly relax and every treatment is personally designed to fit each individual's needs, creating a deeply personal and unique spa experience. The pool is 18m long, and with its stunning lake and mountain views, it is the ideal place to relax and unwind or to swim off the stresses of the day.
The gym is fully-equipped with the latest Technogym equipment.
Lugano is a world-class city and the largest in the Ticino region. There are plenty of things to do and see including lake trips, shopping tours, mountain walks and lunch in one of the Grottos.
Dining

Eros Picco and Tommaso Arrigoni’s on-site restaurant ‘Innocenti Evasioni’ is born from their passion & creativity, and their recipe for success lies in the
flavours
and originality of their dishes. The ingredients used are always fresh and local wherever possible; they are put together with flair to create a selection of Italian and international dishes complemented by an eclectic wine list.
Lugano is also a
centre
of fine dining; we recommend Al Portone (Viale Cassarate 3) for the finest Italo-Swiss dishes. Those up for a drive might consider Il Verderamo (Vicolo del Frate 3A) in Castello Cabiaglio, just under an hour away, for exceptional, unpretentious northern Italian cooking.
