BOUTIQUE HOTELS IN
Portugal


Europe

Hotels

Explore






Once the very tip of Europe’s known world, Portugal has seen off waves of Roman, Arab and Spanish invaders. It’s a staggeringly beautiful country, blessed with a vibrant cultural life, soul-stirring scenery and postcard-worthy sights left behind by its would-be invaders. Visitors flock to Baroque Lisbon for old-world charm and contemporary cool. The southern coast of the Algarve is equally popular, packed as it is with sweeping beaches and pretty coastal towns, but further inland Portugal’s under-the-radar cities are beg to be explored.








Destinations in Portugal










Lisbon Hotels

Sprawled across seven lofty hills, Lisbon’s cobbled neighbourhoods are packed with striking architecture and on-trend digs. With a creative spirit, buzzy bars and moreish custard tarts in its arsenal, this fun-loving city knows how to delight.













Algarve Hotels

From manicured sands to rugged cliffs, the Algarve spans miles of sun-soaked Atlantic coastline. Luxury villas and beachside suites call for idle lounging within easy reach of Faro’s medieval sights and lively nightlife.
