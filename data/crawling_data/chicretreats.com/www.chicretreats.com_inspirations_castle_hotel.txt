CASTLE HOTELS

Inspiration



Holidaying like a king is an exciting prospect for children and adults alike. Stay in a castle and spend your days gazing at the view from a turret, exploring the expansive grounds, feasting in a grand dining hall and, when night falls, sink into a soft four poster bed. The majority of our boutique castle hotels are still owned and partially inhabited by the original family, giving you a unique window into the life of modern nobility.
