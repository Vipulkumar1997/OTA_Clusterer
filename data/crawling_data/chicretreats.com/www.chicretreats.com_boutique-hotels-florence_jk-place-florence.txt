Overview



Introduction

Inspired by the philosophy of personal service and creating a luxurious home away from home, well-known architect Michele Bonan created J.K. Place - the first boutique hotel in Florence. Traditional architecture is artfully combined with contemporary decor, whilst the personality and craftsmanship of local traditions have been carefully maintained.

Set on the square of Santa Maria Novella in the heart of the city - the hotel's rooftop offers wonderful views over the square's beautiful Gothic church by the same name. You can relax with a glass of wine or enjoy a post-theatre dinner at the hotel's sophisticated bar and restaurant - the J.K. Lounge - or head out onto the candlelit terrace for a nightcap before bed.

This hotel offers the perfect bolthole for a weekend city escape. The staff and brilliant Manager, Claudio, go out of their way to ensure you have a great stay and, as a result, people have a tendency to just keep coming back.
Host story




The architect behind JK Place – Michele Bonan - wanted to create not so much a hotel but more of a home away from home – giving the experience of visiting friends in Florence. The human touch is very important to us – our guests are not just a room number and we treat them each personally, calling them by name and talking to them to understand what they would like from their stay. At JK Place, we have about 35 staff and most of them are concierges because they love Florence, they all know the city and the best restaurants and shops – so you can stop Andrea or Matteo and they will happily help you to discover new restaurants and places and call ahead to book for you. Condé Nast Traveller called us tailors of hospitality, which I really love.
- Claudio Meli, General Manager

Activities

Located in the heart of downtown Florence, the city is at your fingertips. Claudio and his team can help with any enquiries and will happily point you towards the best sights, restaurants and experiences - ensuring you are well cared for both at and outside the hotel.
For those who want some pampering, the Olimpo Spa is just two minutes from this luxury hotel and use of the steam room is complimentary for guests.
During December, the Christmas market in Piazza Santa Croce is less than a 15 minute walk from J.K. Place. We'd highly recommend taking a peek at the 'presepe' (nativity scenes) in the churches along the way.

Dining

J.K. Lounge is the hotel's sophisticated bar and restaurant, perfect for a glass of wine and dinner after a day spent exploring Florence. Alternatively, have a romantic drink in the warm light of the Pink Room or out on the terrace.
The restaurant serves innovative contemporary dishes and traditional cuisine. On Sundays, you can enjoy a leisurely brunch with a generous buffet of handmade cakes, tarts, cheese, meats, cereals,  salads, a hot dish to order and freshly-baked bread.
Breakfast is served downstairs in a lovely light-filled room and whilst you can start your day with the usual selection of tea, coffee and juices, the bloody mary's and bellini's are exceptional!
