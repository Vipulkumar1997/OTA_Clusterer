Overview



Introduction

Fontelunga Hotel and Villas was Tuscany's first contemporary boutique hotel. With only eight rooms and two villas, this peaceful hideaway is ideal for those looking for rest and relaxation.

Not your typical Tuscan luxury hotel - this Chic Retreat offers modern design beautifully blended with traditional Italian decor to elegant effect. With no formal hotel "rules", there is a relaxed atmosphere to the place and you can expect friendly and highly personalised service from owners Paolo and Philip and their team. They will go out of their way to ensure you have a good stay and have some wonderful recommendations for the best restaurants and places to visit in the area.

Standing majestically on the edge of the Val di Chiana, the garden of Italy, Fontelunga has expansive views towards the city of Cortona and its mountains beyond. Surrounded by its own olive groves, as well as local sunflower, wheat and fruit farms, it is impossible not to fall in love with the place.

Dogs and children will receive a warm welcome at Fontelunga, with a nanny service available.
Host story
I think the good thing was that neither of us came from a background of hotelier, so what we did was something just totally different. We never thought of it as a standard hotel but developed it more like a home - informal luxury is a big part of our ethos. There’s a sense that formality goes with luxury but that's just not true and we’ve never agreed with that - whenever we travel we like to go to nice places and we like to feel relaxed. One of the things that has become a feature of staying here – is our dinner parties. We host a dinner party two times a week on a Tuesday and a Friday. We used to seat all our guests separately but they would always come together and in the end we just thought "sod it!" – let’s just do a bloody dinner party, we’ll serve everyone together. They’re generally fun!
- Paolo Kastelec & Philip Robinson, Owners

Activities

Tuscany is one of our favourite places for wine, and Fontelunga offers easy access to some of the area's finest wineries. We'd highly recommend asking Paolo and Philip to book you into a wine tasting tour during your stay.
For a relaxing day at the hotel - take a stroll through the surrounding olive groves or have a dip in one of the two pools. Feel truly pampered with a soak in the Jacuzzi or perhaps enjoy a rejuvenating massage (please request prior to arrival).
End your day with a glass of wine in the outdoor gazebo - with comfortable seats and a fireplace, it is a wonderful place to unwind as you gaze up at the stars.
With Florence, Siena, Orvieto and Assisi all within a one hour drive of the hotel, there is plenty of culture at your fingertips. For those in need of retail therapy, the city of Arezzo is an affluent, hidden Tuscan gem with plenty to offer. The factory outlets for Prada, Dolce & Gabanna, Gucci, Fendi, Armani and Sergio Rossi are also close by.

Dining

Twice a week guests are invited to an informal dinner party hosted by Philip and Paolo, where wine and home-made dishes are served in abundance.

While there is no restaurant at the hotel, continental breakfasts, lunches and dinners are all available on request at Fontelunga Hotel and Villas. Whether you fancy a private dinner party, picnic or even a cocktail party, the staff are more than happy to cater for you and Paolo and Philip are more than happy to recommend their favourite restaurants nearby.

If it's a more relaxed evening you are looking for, a mobile pizza oven can be provided (this is Italy after all). For dessert, the hotel offers a bicycle ice cream stand, which serves locally sourced, delicious ice cream. There is also an honesty bar - perfect for an evening drink fireside in the gazebo.

Location




Address

Via Cunicchio 5, Loc.Pozzo, Pozzo della Chiana 52045, Tuscany, Italy

How to get there?

With its remote location you will definitely be best hiring a car to get to Fontelunga and around. The nearest mainline train station is in Arezzo, a 35 minute drive from the hotel (25 km)
By car:
Directions from Rome:
Follow signs to the Autostrada A1, towards Firenze. It is about 180km from the tollbooth and will take 2 hours. Take the Val di Chiana exit. Turn right after the toll gate signposted Foiano. Continue along this road around Foiano (do not enter Foiano) following the signs to Arezzo for about 8 km. Look out for a small blue sign for a left-hand turning towards Pozzo. Take this turning (if you have turned off before this you have taken the wrong turning). On the hill ahead of you, you should be able to see the Villa (a red Villa with blue shutters). Continue along this road past a small yellow church on the left at the foot of the hill. Go up the hill and at the top, turn left up a gravelled road signposted Via Cunicchio to Villa Fontelunga. The Villa is 100 metres on the left-hand side. Please park under the pine trees.
Directions from Milan
: Follow signs for Autostrada A1 towards Bologna-Firenze. Continue after Firenze along the A1 towards Roma. Take the Val di Chiana exit about 1 hour from Firenze. After leaving the Autostrada follow the directions as for Rome.
Directions from Florence
: Initially follow directions for Prato. After approximately 3 minutes, you will see signs for the Autostrada A1. Join the Autostrada in the direction of Roma. Take the Val di Chiana exit about 1 hour from Firenze. After leaving the Autostrada, follow directions as for Rome.
Directions from Pisa
: Leave Pisa airport from the exit adjacent to the car rental parking depot and turn right in the direction signposted Firenze. Follow this road (a dual carriageway) all the way to Firenze. You will eventually, just outside Firenze, come to a signpost for the Autostrada A1 and Roma. Take this turning. Follow the exit off the road and round a bend to the right - you will come to a junction with a tollbooth for the Autostrada ahead of you. Go onto the Autostrada in the direction of Roma, turning off at the Val di Chiana exit and then follow the directions as for Rome.

Nearest airport

Florence Airport is a 1 hour and 15 minute drive from the hotel (99 km)
Pisa airport is a 2 hour drive from the hotel (167 km)
Ciampino airport is a 2 hour 10 minute drive from the hotel (205 km)
Roma Fiumicino airport is a 2 hour 25 minute drive from the hotel (223 km)
Perugia has a small airport called Sant'Egidio, which is a 1 hour drive from the hotel (72 km). It has connections to and from London and Milano Malpensa
