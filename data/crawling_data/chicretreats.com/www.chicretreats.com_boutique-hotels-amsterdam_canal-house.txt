Overview



Introduction

Set across a cluster of 17th-century merchants houses on the canal-front, historical charm abounds at this special spot. Owners Jess and Peter were keen to keep the building's history and personality intact whilst making the necessary updates to create an incredibly comfortable and contemporary boutique hotel. The sumptuous dark colour palette is drawn from the original Dutch artworks and sleek modern furnishings create a stylish and decidedly sultry feel. Unlike many luxury hotels in the city, it boasts a large, romantic garden - perfect to retreat to at the end of a hard day's exploring.

Located on the Keizersgracht canal in Jordaan, the cultural centre of Amsterdam, this is a fantastic spot from which to explore. What's more the staff here are exceptional and offer a warm and personal service that is second to none.
Host story




We stayed here about 20 years ago and knew that if we ever did a hotel in Amsterdam, this would be the one. It’s the perfect size and shape with its enormous garden, history and character – from its entrance to its magnificent sitting room. Quite often when people renovate, they pull everything down and build from scratch but, for us, it's important not just to make reference to Dutch history and Dutch art, we're also trying to be a continuity of what this building has always been – so objects that have lived here longer than we've owned it, we still found a place for them whilst also bringing it up to date.


Design, location and brand are important but it’s all about service. Luxury is about the service being right, that you don't want for anything - you've got everything you need at your fingertips. You decide you want something, you call and the team here will arrange it for you. Tickets for something that's impossible to get, food that's impossible to find or reservations that are impossible to make – they’ll take care of it. It's about the experience that you have in that city that makes you come back and feel that you really understand a place better. That's the trick of travel, the trick of life philosophically – it’s about filling yourself with experiences.
- Jess & Peter Frankopan, Owners

Activities
Amsterdam is a wonderful place to wander around taking in the historical buildings and sights. Only ten minutes from the hotel is the Museum District, which is home to the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. The Anne Frank House is also easy to get to and is an interesting and incredibly moving place to visit.
For those who enjoy a bit of retail therapy, the Nine Streets district is for you. Browse the designer and independent shops to your hearts content, or sit in one of the many cafes and watch the world go by.

Dining

Breakfast at Canal House is a traditional Dutch buffet including local meats, cheeses, fruits and yoghurts. A snack menu is available at the Great Room and Bar, where you can also enjoy a selection of drinks, cocktails and draught beer. If you fancy a quick bite, here you can also enjoy toasties, sandwiches and sweet treats.
There are plenty of lovely restaurants near the hotel, serving a range of local and international dishes. We particularly love Cafe de Curtis, which is tucked away in Jordaan's maze of tiny side streets and
serves deliciously authentic Italian cuisine.

Opening Hours 08.00 - 18.00 Monday - Friday (UK time)






Whilst the interiors of Canal House are contemporary, the 23 rooms draw on the historical influcences of Dutch art and history. Silks and velvets that were popular with the Dutch traders have been used, alongside the dark and light palette of traditional Dutch paintings.
Original features, such as the ornate ceilings and timber beams, have been restored and revived and the combination of traditional and modern creates a uniquely stylish feel.
The latest technology centres this boutique hotel in the 21st century with Blu-Ray players, LCD screens and Bose iPod docking stations. Full size signature Green & Spring bath products are provided throughout your stay.

All of the rooms are individually decorated, the main difference in price being the size of the bedroom and bathroom and the view. Good Rooms or Better Rooms can be converted into twin beds on request. The Best Room is massive and occupies the top floor of the building with views across the Keizersgracht. It has its own sitting area and the bathroom has a huge bath big enough for two.
