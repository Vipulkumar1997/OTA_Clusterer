Overview



Introduction

Set in the heart of Cheltenham, No.131 offers 11 stunning bedrooms in a beautifully converted Georgian townhouse. Making the most of the building's period features, this boutique hotel offers a lovely blend of traditional and modern with intricate cornicing set neatly alongside graphic wallpapers and quirky light fittings. The hotel plays host to a fantastic contemporary art collection with pieces from the likes of Sir Peter Blake, David Hockney and Banksy (to name but a few). The free-standing bathtubs in many bedrooms are a particular highlight - perfect for a romantic weekend away.
The restaurant is a popular spot with guests and locals alike, serving an ever-changing menu of modern British and European fare using plenty of local and seasonal produce and served with real care. The cosy bar is an inviting place to curl up with a glass of something and has a fun, buzzy atmosphere of an evening.
There is a laid-back yet luxurious feel to the place making it an ideal bolt-hole for a weekend escape to the country.
Host story

Our décor is about using the best materials and beautiful furnishings – to offer an understated, cool design as opposed to opulence. Here it’s about independence of spirit – it’s a much more informal atmosphere and the staff are attentive without being in your face. It doesn’t matter who you are – whether you’re a film star or a businessman – you come here and you feel relaxed. The bar has a great atmosphere and the food is fantastic – we’re about wonderful, locally sourced ingredients delivered in a way that makes you feel comfortable in your surroundings. My favourite place in the hotel is a table just off the bar – it’s at exactly the right height for me, surrounded by wines, cabinets and cheeses with the nice buzz from the bar nearby. I love it and you can find me there regularly, I live very locally which is one of the reasons I wanted to get involved!
- Julian Dunkerton, Owner



Activities
Located just 5 minutes from Cheltenham Spa train station, No.131. The Promenade is an easy hideaway to escape to for the weekend or even just one night away and offers a great base for exploring the town and the surrounding Cotswold villages and countryside.

Dining

The restaurant at No.131 The Promenade is a destination in itself, serving up a menu of traditional classics and modern European dishes in a cool and very comfortable setting. Dishes are beautifully presented with a focus on locally sourced, seasonal British ingredients (the tuna is a particular highlight and pudding lovers should try the Salted Caramel Banoffee Cheesecake.) The restaurant is open all day, every day and features daily changing specials and a delicious Afternoon Tea. For a private dinner, you can book one of the four private rooms which seat 12-14 guests.
The bar is also a popular spot - with an extensive cocktail list and collection of spirits (there are around 20 types of gin alone). With a stylish New York vibe - the bar is a buzzy spot on the weekend or equally good for a cosy afternoon over a glass or two of wine.
