The philosophy of Tuscany's luxury hotel Argentario Golf Resort & Spa is all about respect for the environment and our own wellbeing. With views over the golf course, Tuscany's Orbetello Lagoon and Monte Argentario, this contemporary hideaway is situated next to Porto Ercole.
The eco-conscious dragonfly-shaped building features a limestone façade and inside. Interior designer Andrea Fogli, has created a modern style with stylish retro and extravagant features. The 5-star hotel is surrounded by ancient olive trees and woods, which adds to its nature-friendly atmosphere.
Honeymooners, tennis players, sports enthusiasts, foodies, fitness fanatics or
travellers

Activities

Argentario Resort has partnered up with one of the most exclusive beach clubs in the area. Enjoy sun loungers and umbrellas, as you dip in and out of the sea.
Sports enthusiasts can enjoy the three tennis courts, jogging trails, gym, swimming pool and golf course at the hotel. Others may simply want to relax by the pool, be pampered in the spa or sunbathe on the beach. The Espace Wellness Centre is a modern spa which features an indoor pool, sauna, chromotherapy, steam room and 6 treatment rooms.
The 18-hole golf course and driving range were designed by the architect David Mezzacane and the professional golfer Baldovino Dassù. The holes were then shaped by Brian Jorgensen. The result is a varied, spectacular and a technically challenging course even for the most accomplished golfer. Pros are available throughout the year and as the area has its own micro-climate, golfers can enjoy a temperate climate all year round.

Shoppers will love the in-house boutique which sells some of the best Italian and international brands and wines from Italy.
Children don't miss out on the fun here, as there are indoor and outdoor play areas, a children's pool, golf lessons and even a children's spa menu. During the high season, the mini club runs activities. Babysitting can also be arranged.

Dining

Dama Dama Restaurant is an exquisite dining experience with a selection of Tuscan, Italian and Maremman dishes using only the best local ingredients. All dietary preferences can be catered for, and there is also a children's menu available.
If you are feeling virtuous, there is a menu derived by the biologist and nutritionalist, Luca, which contains balanced and healthy meals. There is also a tasting menu, where you can sample various dishes from the land and sea. Enjoy your meal with a glass of wine, chosen from the extensive wine list.
