Overview



Introduction

Overlooking miles of Tuscan countryside, Il Falconiere is an idyllic small boutique hotel in Cortona, Italy. Set on the Baracchi family estate, the hotel's 20 rooms are spread between the estate's old stone villa, the chapel, and the farmhouse.
On site is Il Falconiere's Michelin-star restaurant, where you can enjoy a delicious meal after a day of pampering in the Thesan Etruscan Spa. The Barrachi estate has produced wine for years, and we highly recommend tasting some of their delicious produce.
This Chic Retreat is perfect for exploring the walled city of Cortona. Situated at the heart of the land of the Etruscans, it's a charming and striking medieval hilltop town, which is host to many cultural events throughout the year. The town is home to a famous archaeological museum (MAEC) and is full of little hidden squares and 'Vicoli' - there's always something to discover!
Il Falconiere is an A-lister favourite, with celebrity guests that include Sofia Loren, Jeremy Irons, Frances Mayes (of "Under The Tuscan Sun" fame) and Paolo Rossi.

Host Story

My favourite part about Il Falconiere is that it is a little world of its own, where you can enjoy authentic Tuscan life. I see it as a place to embrace the Italian philosophy of enjoying good things. 'Luxurious' for me means unique and genuine experiences, which is the ethos that inspired the hotel. This is why I think that the most important part of our service is delivering exquisite cuisine, and staff who are constantly on site to greet and assist guests. Each season offers special experiences, but my favourite is the end of the summer when autumn is coming. So many colours, so many flavours and so many things to enjoy.

Activities

Love Tuscan food? Try out the estate's cookery school with lessons on traditional Tuscan and Cortonese cookery. Included in some courses are visits to wineries, wine tastings, and tours of the nearby Tuscan and Umbrian towns. If you would rather have someone else do the cooking while you sample the wines of the area, take the 6-day Grand Wine Tour.
Art-lovers, have your hosts arrange you a fabulous cultural tour. If you like to shop then Arezzo is the place to go, with its designer boutiques and monthly antiques fair. You aren't too far from the designer outlets either, which are about 45 minutes away.
There are also plenty of medieval towns and villages to visit during the day, including Cortona, Arezzo, Siena and Montepulciano.
For pampering, head to the Thesan Etruscan Spa which offers a range of treatments. Ancient relaxation techniques are combined with the finest treatment products, which are sourced from Officina Profumo Farmaceutica Santa Maria Novella, Florence's 800-year old perfumery and pharmacy.

You can also relax by the outdoor pool, which overlooks the cypress trees and olive groves of the valley. For a romantic evening, take a dip in the atmospheric indoor pool by candlelight.

Dining

The Michelin-starred Il Falconiere Restaurant serves up delicious Tuscan and Cortonese cuisine. With several menus to choose from, including a vegetarian and a tasting menu, there is a wealth of dishes to whet your appetite. 'The Hunter' degustation menu is a special treat, incorporating wild game caught in the area and best enjoyed with a glass of their Ardito (which scored 94 on Wine Spectator).
Meals can be served in the restaurant, the glass conservatory, or out on the terrace. For a truly romantic setting, we'd recommend dinner in the Little Clock Room which has just one table. Of course, no meal is complete without selecting a wine from the extensive cellar.
Wake up to a mouthwatering breakfast buffet, which includes an array of sweet and salty tarts, cold cuts, cheese, lamp cooked eggs and other delicacies.
Wonderfully presented and using the freshest of ingredients, the delicious offerings at Il Falconiere are sure to have you returning night after night. However, if you fancy heading out for a meal, there are plenty of places to dine out in the area.
