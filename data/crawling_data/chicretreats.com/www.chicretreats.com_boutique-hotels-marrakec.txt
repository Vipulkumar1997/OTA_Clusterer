Explore






A maze of meandering streets and bustling souks, colourful Marrakech is a haggler’s haven. It’s a soulful, cosmopolitan capital, where weary travellers can find solace in bijou riads and exotic boutique hotels.
More about Marrakech.




When to go

Summers are scorching; opt for autumn or spring instead to explore the medina in comfort. Marrakech winters are pleasingly sunny, but you’ll need a warm wrap for the chilly evenings.

Food & Drink

Packed with traditional and cosmopolitan restaurants, Marrakech tantalises gluttons with bold flavours and colourful dishes. Quench your thirst with a glass of sweet, refreshing juice squeezed from the local oranges. La Bagatelle is a French institution with a shaded terrace. Le Tobsil entertains diners with Moroccan blues in an elegant courtyard. In the Medina, Dar Yacout is as renowned for its magical interior as its scintillating cuisine; make sure to book ahead.

Not to miss

Amble around Jardin Majorelle’s sweet-scented gardens. The iconic cobalt-blue house was once owned by Yves saint Laurent and now houses a fine collection of Berber crafts.



Nightlife

Marrakech’s furtive, boundary-pushing nightlife is all about speakeasy bars and rooftop terraces. Drinking is restricted in the Medina, but you’ll find plenty of cosmopolitan hangouts in the new town. Decadent Comptoir Darna woos guests in an art deco villa with belly dancers and a foliage-veiled courtyard. Prop up the 1920s bar at La Mamounia, a clubby drinking den that once made Churchill feel right at home.

Where to stay in Marrakech

Hide away in a heart-of-the-action riad in the Medina: these revamped houses are decked out with atmospheric courtyards and refreshing plunge pools. If you’re looking for more serene surroundings, head just outside of Marrakech for aristocratic mansions and palm-fringed retreats.

How to get there

A 15-minute drive from the Medina, Marrakech Menara airport serves daily flights to major European hubs.Trains run from the main train station to Casablanca and Fez.
