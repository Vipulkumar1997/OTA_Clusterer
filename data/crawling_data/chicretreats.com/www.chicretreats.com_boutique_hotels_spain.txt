On every hit list for summer sun, Spain lures travellers in with the breathtaking diversity of its landscape and an enduring zest for life. Each of its regions has something to set it apart, and each, naturally boasts of having the most lively bars, head-turning gastronomy and jaw-dropping monuments. Whether for a weekend getaway or a romantic beach break, our Spanish boutique hotels all have one thing in common: they’re all about superlatives.








Destinations in Spain










Andalucia Hotels

One of Spain’s most romantic regions, Andalucia has a fairytale feel. Hilltop fortresses, soaring Gothic churches and exquisite palaces jostle for attention within easy reach of the Costa del Sol’s goldens sands.













Balearic Islands Hotels

A stay in the postcard-perfect Balearic Islands needn’t just mean bars, beaches and pulsing beats. Away from the bustling coastal hotspots, Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza offer style-savvy country houses, charming haciendas and pampering luxury hotels.













East Coast of Spain Hotels

Boisterous Barcelona’s Gothic quarters, tapas bars and Modernist wonders may take centre stage, but this Med-flanking region is also rightfully proud of its miles of golden beaches, idyllic rural retreats and soul-stirring vistas.













Canary Islands Hotels

There’s more to the Canary Islands than all-inclusive resorts and revelry: blessed with year-round sunshine, arcs of spellbinding shores and dramatic volcanic peaks, the archipelago has become a sanctuary for thrill-seekers and idle loungers alike.













Central Spain Hotels

With round-the-clock bars, trendy clubs and inspired art collections, Madrid makes a head-turning base to explore the Spanish heartlands. Beyond the capital, a seductive landscape of ancient hamlets, sprawling forests and spectacular mountain ranges awaits.













Northern Spain Hotels

Home to white-sand beaches, verdant mountains and the culinary capital of San Sebastian, the Basque Country has long cultivated its own sense of place and identity.

LULU TOWNSEND

The Chic Guide to Mallorca


Mallorca is the middle, and largest, of a set of islands set in the Mediterranean off the east cost of Spain. It has a varied terrain, which means that although the majority of visitors come for the coast and beaches, there is a growing interest in the island’s fertile plains and mountainous regions.
