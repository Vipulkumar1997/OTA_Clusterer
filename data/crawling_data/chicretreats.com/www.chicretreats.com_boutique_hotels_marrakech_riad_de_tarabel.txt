Overview



Introduction

Riad de Tarabel is a luxury riad nestled in one of the oldest and most beautiful districts of the Marrakech Medina, near the Dar El Bacha Palace. Unlike many of the riads in Marrakech, Tarabel's owners Rose and Leonard opted for an elegant mix of French and Arabic styles for the interiors with furnishings sourced from all over the world including pieces from Leonard's parents' own château back in France. Hand-made wallpapers and bespoke details make for a decidedly luxurious feel and the service is unfailingly attentive and professional.
With its sun-kissed terraces, hidden corners and tree-lined courtyards - this stunning and serene hideaway is the perfect spot for those after a more refined riad experience. The pool is a wonderful place to relax on a warm afternoon and dinner served up on the terrace with views out over the Medina is a must.
The Riad de Tarabel is adults-only (guests over the age of 16).
Host story
Really we built it as a house for us in the beginning but then we had a lot of people wanting to stay, so we decided to turn it into a hotel. We now have 10 rooms but we won’t make it bigger because the soul of the house would change and the atmosphere would change. We wanted to create a very peaceful atmosphere. With it being only 10 rooms, you don’t realise there are other people in the riad – it’s like having your own home in Marrakech. The décor is a real mixture – with the Moroccan architecture but then art and furniture from all over the world. Our decoration is the real difference between us and the 900 other riads in Marrakech – CNN came and said that we were one of the top riads here.

Activities

Marrakech is great for a 3-night dash or a week long stay. Shop until you drop in the souks or head to the new town of Gueliz, where you'll be spoilt for choice on great interior and leather shops.

The Red City is an incredible place to pass an afternoon or spend a few hours at Yves Saint Laurent's Jardin Majorelle. If you are staying longer than 3 nights, we'd recommend heading out of the city on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains.

For a spot of relaxation, spend a day by the swimming pool or cool off in the roof-top plunge pool. Massages and beauty treatments are also available and you can hone your cooking skills with one of Tarabel's cookery courses. General manager Laurent and his excellent staff are also more than happy to organise treks, leisure activities or events.


Dining

Imagine an elegant and exclusive restaurant in Paris; that is how you'll feel dining at Riad de Tarabel. Whilst there's no official restaurant per se, the charming staff will set you up a table wherever you choose. Whether by candlelight in a quiet corner of the courtyard or up on the terrace with views out over the Medina - you'll enjoy the chef's wonderful mix of French and Moroccan cuisine. Just be sure to arrive with an appetite – the meals are abundant! Alcohol is also served in the riad (not a given in the Medina) and the staff will happily bring you your tipple of choice.

Breakfast is absolutely delicious. Sample Moroccan specialities, including divine pancakes and a range of fresh pastries, muesli, home-made yoghurts, cakes, cooked-to-order eggs, fruits and juices.
