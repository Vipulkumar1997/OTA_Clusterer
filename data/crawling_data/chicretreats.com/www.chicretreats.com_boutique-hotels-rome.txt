Homeland of the ancients, Rome brims with historical ruins and intrigue. Curious travellers could spend days here flitting from Renaissance chapels to splashing centuries-old fountains. It’s not all coliseums, catacombs and cosseting boutique hotels however: the Italian capital’s hole-in-the-wall trattorias and family-run gelaterias will ensure you don’t leave the city hungry.

More about Rome.




When to go

The summer heat can be stifling, so for pleasant climes and room to roam visit in early summer or late autumn. Don’t be put off by Rome’s notorious wet winters ㅡ they’re usually mild, and the perfect excuse for a spot of museum-hopping.

Food & Drink

The Italian capital is renowned for its artichokes, which have been rubber-stamped by the EU for deliciousness. Try them in a light crispy batter at Nonna Betta in the Jewish quarter, or as a tasty antipasto. You’d be remiss for not checking out the local pizza joints; stop by Pizzeria da Baffetto for wafer-thin specimens.

Not to miss

Indulge your senses in the Garden of Oranges, where fragrant citrus trees set the scene for breathtaking city views.



Nightlife

Italians tend to dine late, so don’t be surprised if the bars don’t fill up before 10pm. You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to late-night haunts. Try to squeeze in a visit to Il Goccetto, an authentic wine bar in a former medieval bishop’s house serving delicious
vino rosso
.

Where to stay in Rome

At the heart of the action, Piazza Navona hosts sensitively restored historical digs; Trastevere is handy if you’re planning a Vatican visit. Museum hounds and art fiends should bunk down near Piazza di Spagna (the local gelaterias aren’t bad, either).

How to get there

Rome has two airports, Ciampino and Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino, both of which serve daily domestic and international flights.
