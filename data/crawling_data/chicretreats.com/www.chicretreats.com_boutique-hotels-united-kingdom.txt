BOUTIQUE HOTELS IN
United Kingdom


Europe

Hotels

Explore






Packed as it is with rugged mountain ranges, poetry-inspiring vistas and idyllic coastline, pint-sized Britain has little cause to envy its more sprawling Continental neighbours. No city better embodies the United Kingdom’s plucky spirit than London, perhaps, but outside of the capital, the country’s verdant hills, rural boltholes and vibrant cities bear testament to the firm belief that there really is no place like home.








Destinations in United Kingdom










England Hotels

A playground for rural enthusiasts, the English countryside beckons with quaint villages, pristine coves and rambling trails through lake and forest country. Well-heeled London is endlessly fascinating, but England’s under-the-radar cities can be just as charming.













Scotland Hotels

A sandstone sprawl of museums, designer shops and pretty streets, Edinburgh is a characterful stepping stone to Highland adventures. Romantic retreats await: explore a dramatic landscape of glassy lochs, heather-covered hills and Caribbean-esque beaches.













Wales Hotels

From the jagged peaks of Snowdonia to the lively city of Cardiff, Wales' national parks are a draw for sports enthusiasts. This verdant country knows how to pamper and treat, too, thanks to gorgeous sandy beaches and a scattering of luxury hotels.
