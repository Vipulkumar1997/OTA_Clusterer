Explore






From the snowy peaks of the Dolomites to the sun-drenched beaches of Sicily, Italy weaves through tranquil farmland, mesmerising coastlines and a wealth of history. For city breaks Rome has its monuments, Venice its cinematic canals and Naples its out-of-this-world pizza, but away from these cosmopolitan hubs, rural life is just as postcard-worthy. Head inland for a taste of classic Italy peppered with boutique hotels, zhuzhed-up rural kitchens and sparkling infinity pools.








Destinations in Italy










Rome Hotels

Homeland of the ancients, Rome brims with historical ruins and intrigue. Curious travellers could spend days here flitting from Renaissance chapels to splashing centuries-old fountains, before cosying up in boutique hotels and luxury suites.













Tuscany Hotels

When it comes to postcard-perfect loveliness, Tuscany’s mist-softened hills and red-roofed villages are second to none. The region’s cities are just as enticing: expect revamped farmhouses, elegant urban boltholes and pool-blessed palazzos.













Sicily Hotels

A sun-blessed destination for seaside frolics, Sicily is an island of undisputed beauty. Unspoilt beaches, time-stood-still villages and the dramatic antics of Mount Etna are just some of its alluring charms.













Puglia Hotels

Tucked between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, Puglia is a land of thriving olive groves, golden beaches and ancient villages. Today, medieval palaces and rustic farmhouses play host to boutique retreats and spa hideaways set in gentle rolling plains.













Sardinia Hotels

Just off Italy’s west coast, Sardinia is a haven for sun-and-sand lovers. The island’s Mediterranean legacy – limestone towns, neolithic artefacts and hearty cuisine – ensures there’s a lot more to explore beyond glitzy Costa Smeralda’s picturesque coves.













Umbria Hotels

Laced with olive groves and vineyards, Umbria is the green heart of the country. From the mountains of Perugia to the hilltop town of Orvieto, this is Italy at its traditional best, where truffle-hungry foodies flock for a taste of nonna’s cooking.













Veneto Hotels

From the foothills of the Alps to Venice’s scintillating lagoon, a stay here is all about romance. Veneto’s luxury villas, art-inspired hotels and canalside boltholes have much to enthrall.













Campania Hotels

Quintessentially Italian, Campania has magnificent palaces, awe-inspiring vistas and game-changing pizzas in droves. Away from the hustle and bustle of Naples’ vivacious streets, Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast beckon seductively.













Lazio Hotels

Packed with spectacular art, culture, shopping and food, underrated Lazio begs to be explored. Homeland of the ancients, Rome brims with historical ruins and intrigue, with beaches, cliffs and untouched coves just a day trip away.
