Explore






Born from a centuries-old meeting of cultures, Venice’s dream-like atmosphere is spellbinding. Kitted out with crumbling palaces, criss-crossing bridges and stripe-shirted gondoliers, its maze of canals is strikingly cinematic. But there’s much more to this lagoon city than its iconic waterways and Rococo sights: get lost in hidden alleyways, feast on seafood-flecked
cicchetti

and stay in romantic palazzos cleverly transformed into bijou boutique hotels.

More about Venice.




When to go

Late spring and early summer are perfect for exploring before the intense summer heat hits. Rising water levels aren’t unheard of between October and January, but don’t be put off: it’s a rare chance to have the museums all to yourself.

Food & Drink

Fish takes pride of place on Venetian menus. Book early to bag one of the nine tables in intimate Il Ridotto, where you can sample imaginative seafood dishes in a minimalist setting. Elsewhere, Osteria Santa Marina knows how to seduce its guests with immaculately presented dishes in a candlelit garden.

Not to miss

Listen to the songs of the gondoliers as you slink across the Grand Canal.



Nightlife

Evenings in Venice are laid-back. Head to the Lido area for a buzzy vibe and a generous sprinkling of bars. Join locals for a glass (or two) of wine while nibbling on cicchetti, the local tapas. Watch the city light up from the Skyline Rooftop bar; literary buffs will love Caffe Florian, where Lord Byron used to while away his nights.

Where to stay in Venice

Bursting with elegant shops and chic galleries, San Marco is right at the heart of the city. If you’re after a quieter neighbourhood, Campo San Leonardo plays hosts to boho restaurants and hole-in-the-wall drinking dens.

How to get there

Venice Marco Polo Airport serves regular flights from domestic and European destinations, as well as seasonal flights from international hubs. From there, book a water taxi to arrive in style.
