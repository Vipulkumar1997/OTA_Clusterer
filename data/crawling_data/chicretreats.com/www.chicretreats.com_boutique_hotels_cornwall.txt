Explore






Stretching down the coast, windswept Cornwall is a haven for artists, surfers and foodies. Wander through winding cobbled streets, bask on sweeping beaches or sip cream teas in cute cafes. When the sun sets, you’ll be rewarded with enticing boltholes: expect roll-top baths, sea-view suites and spa-blessed beauties.

More about Cornwall.




When to go

June is good for beach-worthy weather without the high-summer crowds. September and October’s still-warm temperatures and impressive waves make for exhilarating surfing.

Food & Drink

It’s not all freshly-baked pasties in Cornwall: the sea’s bounty takes pride of place in beach shacks, cosy pubs and award-winning haunts. Michelin-star-studded Restaurant Nathan Outlaw makes the most of the coast’s remarkable seafood, transforming it with delicate and piquant flavours. Don’t leave without sampling a traditional Cornish cream tea, complete with crumbly scones, clotted cream and homemade jams.

Not to miss

Climb up to the clifftop Minack theatre, where you can watch an open-air performance against a glorious ocean backdrop.



Nightlife

Strung across the Cornish shores are an array of cosy inns and seaside pubs, where you can sample home-brewed ales from the well-deserved comfort of an armchair. For a lively evening scene, head to Newquay, which plays host to dusk-to-dawn clubs, fun-loving haunts and buzzing cocktail bars.

Where to stay in Cornwall

St Ives is a surfer’s paradise, with sweeping beaches surrounding its rustic cottages and luxury retreats. Dotted across Cornwall’s southern coast are thriving harbour towns and seaside villages, including Falmouth and Mousehole, which are the perfect spots for a relaxing weekend break.

How to get there

Cornwall is easily accessible by car, with excellent train links to London, including Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as Birmingham.
