Explore






Whitewashed houses perch on Devon’s hilly seafront, overlooking golden, rugged beaches. Hike over craggy cliffs, dip your toes into cool ocean or wonder at the region’s incredible fossil collections. It’s not just its natural assets that make Devon so appealing: the coastal county is a haven for boutique hotels, pampering spas and cosy cottage retreats.

More about Devon.




When to go

Beach-goers should visit in early summer or autumn for mild weather without the late-summer crowds.

Food & Drink

Devon is a hotspot for foodies, with its tasty heritage and outstanding eateries. Arguably the birthplace of the cream tea, the county knows its way around fluffy scones, rich clotted cream and fruity jams. For something heartier, head to River Cottage in Axminster, owned by celebrity chef, Hugh Fearnly-Whittingstall. Here you can tuck into inventive seasonal dishes, or whip up your own in one of the many cookery classes on offer.

Not to miss

Catch a steam train in Dartmouth and soak up the picturesque views as you fly past.



Nightlife

For pulse-racing nights head to Exeter: the university town has plenty of quirky bars and late-night haunts. The fun doesn’t end there: you’ll also find nightclubs and cocktail dens on Torquay’s riviera, where you can sip on delicious concoctions while gazing out over Devon’s lively coast.

Where to stay in Devon

Torquay’s busy harbour, bustling shops and lively evening scene make for a quintessentially English seaside break. Alternatively, rest your head in the small port town of Ilfracombe, where you’ll find a clutch of coastal hideaways and luxury hotels.

How to get there

Devon has train links to London, including Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as Birmingham.
