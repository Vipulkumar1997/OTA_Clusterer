Baguettes, bicycles and Breton tops: so familiar is the French cultural landscape that a getaway across the channel has become a byword for effortless pleasure. That’s not to say the country could be summed up by a series of clichés –
au contraire
. From the windswept tip of Normandy to the crashing breaks of Biarritz, France is a tapestry of beautiful cities, masterpiece-inspiring landscapes and out-of-this-world culinary experiences. Experience a bit of
joie de vivre
in one of its elegant boutique boltholes.








Destinations in France










Paris Hotels

A prime contender for romantic getaways, the City of Lights is one of neighbourhoods, each with a distinct history of its own. Today’s Paris embraces its creative spirit with contemporary galleries, innovative restaurateurs and of-the-moment luxury hideaways.













South of France Hotels

From the star-studded Côte d’Azur to the wild waves of the Pays Basque, this varied landscape has inspired artists, filmmakers and Michelin-flirting chefs. Check in to the region’s châteaux, mansions and romantic stone-clad cottages.













Northern France Hotels

Northern France’s earthy charms are a boon to travellers in search of rural peace. Rich with creamy cheeses and fiery Calvados, the region’s larder ensures food is taken very seriously indeed – as is a warm welcome in cosseting hotels.
