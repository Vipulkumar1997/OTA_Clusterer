Trump Organization and Trump SoHo cut ties

The owner of the struggling Trump SoHo building in New York City reached a deal to end its contract with the Trump Organization early.
Trump SoHo is a condominium hotel in a posh downtown Manhattan neighborhood. Although it brandishes the Trump name, it's owned by CIM Group, a California-based real estate investment firm.

Sri Lanka vows to decriminalize homosexuality, protect LGBT citizens

The Sri Lankan government tells human rights experts that it plans to decriminalize homosexuality, Gay Times reports.

Gay sex is currently illegal in Sri Lanka under an archaic "gross indecency" law inherited from the country's colonial past. Sri Lanka's Deputy Solicitor General, Nerin Pulle, has pledged to reassess and change the country's penal code in response to their third Universal Periodic Review, a United Nations Human Rights Council process in which U.N. countries scrutinize human rights records of other U.N. members.

Romania gay marriage case could have outsize impact in Europe

The European Union's highest court began examining a case on 21 November over a Romanian man's attempts to get legal residency for his American husband, a closely watched hearing that will have major implications for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships across Europe.

The case, legal experts say, could determine whether same-sex partners are afforded some of the same benefits and rights available to heterosexual spouses across the 28-member bloc, irrespective of the countries’ stance on same-sex marriage.

Harvard study: LGBT people of color suffer double discrimination

Legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw's theory of intersectionality — the idea that the different aspects of our identities are like roads, and that those who live at particular intersections experience unique forms of discrimination — has been used since 1989 to explore the ways in which racial prejudice can amplify other forms of bigotry.

Now, when it comes to the differences between the experiences of white LGBTQ people and LGBTQ people of color, there is new nationally-representative data that underscores the continuing relevance of that theory.

Egypt jails 16 for 'debauchery' as LGBT crackdown continues

Sixteen men arrested last month during a crackdown on homosexuality by the authorities in Egypt have been sentenced to three years in prison.

A court in Cairo found 14 of them guilty of "inciting debauchery" and "abnormal sexual relations" recently. The other two were convicted on 27 November. However, they have reportedly been freed on bail of 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($282; £211) each pending an appeal.

Discrimination in China is high, but gays finally feel emboldened to combat homophobia

Peng Yanhui still remembers shuddering when he testified three years ago about doctors using electroshock therapy to try changing his sexual orientation to straight.

"I was very nervous," Peng said. "I screamed so loud when they poked my arm with an electric shock (device)."

Peng, founder of LGBT Rights Advocacy in this southern Chinese city, had gone undercover and sought out the bogus treatment to gather evidence that doctors were falsely advertising a "cure" for homosexuality on the Internet.

Anti-LGBT hate crimes double since 'gay propaganda' law in Russia

Hate crimes against LGBT people in Russia have doubled since the country instituted a law banning "gay propaganda," researchers told Reuters recently.

The banning resulted in an increase of sentences for crimes against LGBT people from 18 in 2010 to 65 in 2015, according to St. Petersburg-based researchers who pulled their data from court records and the judicial watchdog RosPravosudie.

'Upset with Lam's lukewarm response': 10,000 attend Pride Parade amid calls for Hong Kong laws to protect LGBT rights

Rainbow flags and blue balloons were part of the flamboyant displays on Hong Kong streets on 25 November as advocates and members of the LGBT community joined hands in the ninth annual Pride Parade, attended by 10,000 people, according to organizers. The festivities were held against the backdrop of an ongoing public consultation over the legal recognition of transgender and intersex people.

Report: 'Terrorized at home', Central America's LGBT people to flee for their lives

Killings and violence against LGBT people in Central America are driving hundreds to flee their homes each year, but they have no safe sanctuary to run to, Amnesty International said recently.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are being forced to leave El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala to escape "epidemic levels of violence" and threats by criminal gangs and security forces, the rights group said in a report.

More LGBT couples and fewer heterosexual couples are applying to adopt children in the UK

More gay couples and fewer heterosexual couples are applying to adopt children in Britain, new figures show.

Last year, one in seven adoption orders was made by a gay couple.

Wilsons, a private law firm that analyzed the figures, noted that the number of gay couples applying for adoption increased from 510 in 2013-2014 to 586 last year. Sarah Wood-Heath, an associate lawyer at Wilsons, said: "The door has really opened now for all kinds of individuals to start their own family."

Gay couple, devout baker take cake fight to high court

When Charlie Craig and David Mullins swung open the door to Jack Phillips' bakery on a summer day in 2012, they were just going to see a man about a cake. 

Now all three of them are going to the Supreme Court — because, as it turned out, Masterpiece Cakeshop doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. 

The five-year-old legal tussle over Phillips' confections and the gay couple's affections will reach its zenith next week, when lawyers for both sides as well as the state of Colorado and the United States come before the nation's highest court to debate the expressive content of a wedding cake.
