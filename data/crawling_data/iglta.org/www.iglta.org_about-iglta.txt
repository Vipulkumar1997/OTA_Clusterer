About IGLTA





LGBTQ Travelers are Welcome Here

The leading member-based global organization dedicated to LGBTQ tourism.

The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association is the world's leading global travel network dedicated to connecting and educating LGBTQ travelers and the businesses that welcome and support them along the way. Whether it's for individual, group, corporate, or student travel, we have affiliates in the world's most sought after locations offering the most competitive packages for your perfect vacations.

IGLTA was founded in 1983 by gay and lesbian travel agents and now operates in 80+ countries on all six inhabited continents. We provide all members who join the IGLTA community the opportunity to customize their travel experience and share it with others through planning tools, trip ideas, events and travel deals from LGBTQ tourism-related businesses.



Our Mission


The mission of IGLTA is to provide information and resources for LGBTQ travelers and expand LGBTQ tourism globally by demonstrating its significant social and economic impact.


Our History


Founded in 1983 by a dedicated group of 25 travel agents and hotel owners, IGLTA has expanded exponentially as LGBTQ rights and visibility have grown around the world. The original name was IGTA; the "L" was added in 1997. Today, the association has a truly global presence with member businesses in more than 80 countries. IGLTA represents LGBTQ and LGBT-friendly accommodations, destinations, service providers, travel agents, tour operators, and events, as well as the LGBTQ travel consumers they wish to serve.

TESTIMONIAL:

“Marketing the 2011 glbt travel expo tour through the IGLTA was enormously successful. This is a new event and I needed to get out the word to travel related companies throughout the world. By sponsoring the IGLTA newsletter, I was able to do that. As soon as the newsletter was sent out, I saw a four fold increase in traffic on my website. That was followed up by phone calls from companies who were interested in becoming exhibitors. My banner ads on the website were just as successful but the response more steady and long term.”

Note that all marketing opportunities are available exclusively to existing IGLTA members only.  IGLTA reserves the right to refuse any advertising piece(s).
