Since the first Gay Games in 1982, the Federation of Gay Games has promoted equality in and by sport and culture and ensured that the Gay Games take place every four years under the founding principles of Participation, Inclusion, and Personal Best™.

The FGG and its member organizations:


select the host of each edition of the Gay Games

transmit and enhance know-how from host to host as to rules, requirements, and best practice

monitor and support the execution of the Gay Games

represent the LGBT perspective to sport and culture organizations and events

represent the sport perspective to LGBT and human rights groups and events


The Federation of Gay Games is nearly an all-volunteer organisation made up of individuals and organisations representing four continents. The Federation consists of a board of directors and an assembly of local and international organisations. These member organisations are single or multi-sport clubs and federation, cultural groups, and can be local, regional, national or international in scope. The member organisations are more than a list of groups that support the Gay Games; their delegates are actively involved in the Federation’s work and decision-making processes. All are dedicated to ensuring the continuation of the Gay Games’ decades of history of inspiration and achievement.

The next Gay Games will take place in  Paris from August 4 to 12 2018, with 36 sport, 14 cultural events, and 1 sports conference.  Thousands and athletes and artists from around the world will meet in Paris for a Celebration of Diversity.
