Enjoy the iconic monuments along the beautiful National Mall, acclaimed theater at renowned venues like the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and Arena Stage, outstanding shopping in historic Georgetown and inside the fashion-forward CityCenterDC and great sporting entertainment from five professional franchises.

Explore DC’s nightlife and a flourishing dining scene that has been rewarded with a
Michelin Guide
. Acclaimed restaurants from renowned chefs such as José Andrés and Eric Ziebold have turned the city into a culinary capital ready to wow your taste buds.

The city is easy to access, with three local airports available. Navigating DC is also simple, whether by foot, via bike rental with Capital Bikeshare or through the city’s efficient Metrorail system.

DC offers unique cultural diversity, pairing international influence with a distinct local identity. From people watching in Dupont Circle to power watching on Capitol Hill; from the high-heeled drag race on 17th Street to the drag-queen brunches of Adams Morgan; from the funky stores of U Street to the happy hours in Penn Quarter, Washington, DC has unique windows and doorways for the LGBTQ visitor.
