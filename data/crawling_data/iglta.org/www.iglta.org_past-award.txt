IGLTA Awards








IGLTA Recognizes William Pate of the ACVB


16 August 2017



IGLTA Recognizes William Pate of the ACVB



William Pate, President & CEO, Atlanta CVB, received an award of appreciation from IGLTA for his commitment to diversity and inclusion and ensuring Atlanta remains a welcoming destination for conventions and tourists alike on 16 August during the ASAE Annual Meeting & Exposition 2017 in Toronto. When Georgia Senate Bill 129, referred to as the Georgian Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, was introduced during the 2015 legislative session, Pate immediately rallied his team at the Atlanta CVB to gather compelling information to fight this harmful anti-gay legislation. His swift, preemptive actions to collaborate with the local business community against this bill were instrumental in its defeat. The following year, HB 757, a similar bill, was introduced but the Atlanta CVB was already armed with powerful independent data that underscored the damaging economic effects this bill would have. Once again, the bill did not make it into law. His visionary actions are a model for other states that are now engaging in similar attacks on equality. Pate presented a case study on the topic during LGBT Week in New York City earlier this year.
