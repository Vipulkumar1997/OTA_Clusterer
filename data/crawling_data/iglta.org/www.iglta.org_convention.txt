“
“This is the first opportunity I have had to come to an IGLTA conference and it has been an amazing experience meeting with all the Buyers/Suppliers and learning more about the products they have to offer for me to use toward selling to our LGBT clients.  The Conference was very enlightening and informative. I am looking forward to 2018 in Toronto!”
