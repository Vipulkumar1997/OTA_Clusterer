Privacy Policy





IGLTA Website Privacy Policy

Effective: April 9, 2012

SUMMARY
International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, Inc. (“IGLTA” “we” or “us”) operates the
IGLTA.ORG, IGLTA.COM, lgbt.travel, iglta.travel, igltaconvention.org websites
(collectively, the “Site”), which are hosted in the United States. We want you, the visitor to our public website, to understand how we collect and use data about your Site visit. This privacy policy identifies the information the Site collects and the purposes for which such information may be used.  For IGLTA’s purposes, the Site collects “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you. This may include your name, address, email address, telephone or fax number, IP address, any content you post, and certain other information, which we explain in more detail below. We also use cookies, which gather certain forms of information from your computer to help us monitor and improve Site usage and performance. You can choose not to provide us with this information, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you.

We do not disclose this information to third parties for their marketing or sales purposes, but we do use third party software and services to assist us with collecting and analyzing information regarding use of the Site. We may also disclose your information to others for other purposes, for example, if required to do so by law. The privacy policy for the Site is set forth below.  Please contact us at
PRIVACY@IGLTA.ORG
if you have questions or concerns about this policy or the use of your information.

USING THE SITE GENERALLY

INFORMATION COLLECTION
This is our online privacy policy (“Web Privacy Policy”). This Web Privacy Policy applies only to activities we engage in on the Site and does not apply to activities that are "offline" or unrelated to the Site. You should note that different privacy policies may apply to other parts of IGLTA’s web presence – for example, posting career opportunities or resume submission web pages that have separate privacy policies.

We may collect two types of information through this Site: anonymous information and personally identifiable information. We collect certain anonymous data regarding the usage of the website. This information does not personally identify users. We gather it to improve the performance of the Site. The anonymous data we collect can include information such as the type of browser you are using, IP address, the pages you view, and the length of your visit to the Site.

We may also ask you to provide personally identifiable information on the Site, which may include your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, fax number or company name. This information can be gathered when you send us an e-mail, subscribe to e-mails and newsletters, subscribe to membership, or when we set cookies. In all such cases you choose whether to provide us with any of the personally identifiable information, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you if you do not provide the personally identifiable information requested.

COOKIES

Cookies are small bits of data cached or stored on your computer based on Internet activity. We use cookies to monitor individual activity in aggregate to improve the Site. The information we gather includes IP address, user language, the operating system, browser type, the presence/absence of “flash” plug-ins, screen resolution, connection type, and information that identifies the cookie. However, no other user information is generally collected.

USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
We do not sell, trade or rent to others your personally identifiable information collected on the Site.

Uses by IGLTA

We use the information collected through the Site for statistical purposes, for improving the Site, as well as for our membership services, marketing purposes and potentially sending emails to you. We typically engage a third party’s software or services to assist us with these collections and analyses. As a practical matter, we must release your email address to a service to provide you with information you requested. We may use third-parties to assist us with our membership services and marketing efforts, including assisting us with sending emails to you. This may include sending you electronic newsletters and membership-related emails for services described on our Site. However, you will have the choice to opt out of receiving newsletters and emails for our services by either contacting us directly at
IGLTA@IGLTA.ORG
or through the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of our newsletters and emails.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information to respond to a subpoena, court order or other such legal request. We may also provide such personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or as otherwise required by law.

We may provide your personally identifiable information to a third party if we file for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership in connection with proposed or consummated corporate reorganizations, such as mergers, acquisitions, creation of subsidiaries, assignment or sales of business units.

Uses by Third-Parties
We do not provide your personally identifiable information to any third party for their own marketing, solicitation or sales purposes.

INFORMATION SECURITY

You are responsible for ensuring that any log-in credentials (your username and password) are kept confidential.  We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personally identifiable information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
