AirAsia History


When it was established in 1993, AirAsia was owned by the Malaysian Government. But, in 2001, the former executive of Time Warner, Tony Fernandes, took over AirAsia from the Malaysian Government. Fernandes decided to leave his former job in order to fulfill his childhood dream: to build the first low-cost airline in Asia. Fernandes might not have the experience of running an airline company, but thanks to his extraordinary marketing team, AirAsia was able to officially start their business in 2002 with some new routes at a competitively low promotion cost.

In 2003, AirAsia opened a second hub at Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru near Singapore. For the first time, AirAsia launched its first international flight to Thailand. Thai AirAsia was also launched at that time with new flight routes to Singapore and Indonesia. The flight to Macau began operating in 2004, followed by flights to Manila and Xiamen in 2005. Still within the same year, AirAsia also opened new flight routes to Vietnam and Cambodia. A year after that, new flight routes to Brunei Darussalam and Myanmar were also opened. In August 2006, AirAsia took over Malaysia Airlines’s Rural Air Service routes in Sabah and Sarawak, operating under the FlyAsianXpress brand. But the routes were returned to MASwings a year later due to commercial issues.

At the end of 2006, Fernandes unveiled a five-year plan to further enhance AirAsia’s presence in Asia. AirAsia proposed enhancing its route network by connecting all of its existing destinations throughout the region and expanding further into Vietnam, Indonesia, Southern China, and India. Through its company sisters, Thai AirAsia and Indonesia AirAsia, the plan called for a focus on developing its hub in Bangkok and Jakarta. With increased frequency and new routes, AirAsia increased its passenger volume to 13.9 million in 2007. The volume was continuously increasing that by early 2013, AirAsia’s profits increased by 168% compared to the same period in 2012. By then end of 2012, the airline’s net profit stood at RM350.65 million (around Rp1 trillion) despite a 1% rise in the average fuel price.

The triumph of AirAsia Group in operating short-distance flight encouraged Fernandes and team to spread their wings. They opened a long-distance flight service under a new airline name called AirAsia X. In 2007, AirAsia X launched its first long-distance flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Gold Coast, Australia. Today, AirAsia flies to more than 120 destinations in Southeast Asia and Australia. In its day-to-day operation, AirAsia flies Airbus A320 and A330. Airbus A320, which can carry 180 passengers, is used for flights under four hours, while Airbus A330, which accommodates 377 passengers, is used for long-distance flights.

In early 2017, AirAsia X finally received an official license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate a flight to the US. This makes AirAsia X the first low-cost airline in Asia licensed to serve scheduled commercial flights to the US, providing it with a greater opportunity to open new flight routes to any destinations in the US, including Hawaii. For an airline that predominantly serves the Asian, Australian, and the Middle East markets, this is considered as a great achievement.  AirAsia X is now eager to try new markets, and is considering to re-open the flight route to London.
