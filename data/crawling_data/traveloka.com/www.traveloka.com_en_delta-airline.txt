About Delta Air Lines


Delta Air Lines (IATA code: DL)
was established in May 1924 under the name Huff Daland Dusters and began its operation in June 1929. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia with the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as its main hub, Delta Air Lines currently has eight other hubs, which include Salt Lake City International Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol among others. The airline operates flight service to many destinations in six continents, including Africa, which it has served since 2006. Starting as a small-scale airline, today Delta Air Lines is a growing airline with 160 million passengers each year.

With its slogan “Keep Climbing”, Delta Air Lines achieves numerous awards. This year alone, the airline has received five awards, including being listed in Fortune magazine’s Most Admired Companies list and Business Travel Award’s Business Airline of the Year 2017. Last year, the airline received Honor for Workplace Diversity also from Fortune magazine, and for two consecutive years, the Full Service Airline Brand of the Year award from Harris Poll EquiTrend. The airline has also received an Employees’ Choice Award from Glassdoor. 

Delta Air Lines has offered a loyalty program since 1981 which they branded as SkyMiles in 1985. SkyMiles members can earn miles from every flight with Delta Air Lines and its partner airlines, as well as from credit card usage, hotel reservation, restaurant dining, or shopping. SkyMiles offers four membership tiers, which are Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each tier comes with different benefits, from priority waitlist, check-in, to boarding. The higher the membership tier, the more benefits the members can enjoy. Accumulated miles can be redeemed for free flight ticket, shopping, flight class upgrade, and many more.

Delta Air Lines offers six different flight classes, consisting of Basic Economy, Main Cabin, Delta Comfort+, First Class, Delta Premium Select, and Delta One. As the topmost cabin class, Delta One offers a luxurious flight experience for its passengers on long haul flights. Although LCD touchscreens are provided in all cabin classes to meet passengers’ entertainment needs, the ones in Delta One are bigger and come with noise-canceling headsets to enhance the passengers’ experience. 

All Delta Air Lines passengers can carry one cabin baggage and one personal item onboard. Personal items may include wallets, camera bags, or laptops, strollers, umbrellas, and jackets. Passengers traveling in Basic Economy, Main Cabin and Delta Comfort+ may bring up to 23 kg of baggage, while passengers traveling in Delta Premium, Delta One and First Class are allowed baggage of 2 x 23 kg. All checked baggage must be dropped at the check-in counter. There are four check-in options available, which are online, mobile app, kiosk, and counter. Both kiosk and online check-in can be accessed from 24 hours before the flight. For domestic flights, check-in counters will be closed 30 minutes before departure, while for international flights, they will be closed one hour before departure.


Delta Air Lines History


When it was launched in 1924, Delta Air Lines was named after its founder, Huff Daland Dusters. In 1928, when the airline was bought by Collett E. Woolman, the airline changed its name to Delta Air Service. The first flight operation took place in 1929 using Travel Air S-6000B airplanes. Almost 50 years later, Delta Air Lines began to operate long-haul passenger flights using all-jet passenger planes, such as Boeing 747. Due to fuel efficiency issue, the Boeing aircraft were then replaced by Lockheed Tristar. 

Delta Air Lines strengthened its position in the aviation industry by acquiring other airlines, such as Northeast Airlines in the 1970s and Western Airlines in 1985. The period, specifically in 1980, also saw Delta Air Lines launching a frequent flyer program for its passengers. Upon Pan Am bankruptcy in 1991, Delta Air Lines conducted a merger and bought some of its flight routes, mostly to Europe, which expanded its European destinations. The period also saw Delta Air Lines opening flight routes through its Portland hub to Asian cities such as Bangkok, Fukuoka, Tokyo, Nagoya, Hong Kong and Taipei.

In 2000, Delta Air Lines along with Air France, Aeromexico and Korean Air founded SkyTeam, which is now one of the world’s biggest airline alliances. During the same year, Delta Air Lines also improved its operational activities by purchasing Boeing 737-800, a double machine aircraft. 

Seven years later, Delta Air Lines experienced bankruptcy, which prompted it to merge with Northwest Airlines in 2008 to expand its flight network. Since this merger, both airlines have operated their flight service under the Delta Air Lines brand, and in 2010, both airlines merged their ticket booking and online service. 

Pan Am and Northwest Airlines were not the only airlines Delta Air Lines has merged with. Delta Air Lines had also conducted a merger with Chicago and Southern Airlines (1953), Northeast Airlines (1972), and Western Airlines (1987). These mergers had become Delta Air Lines’ strategy to become the most renowned airlines in the world while expanding its network and businesses. Among the airline’s subsidiaries are Comair, Delta Express, and Song.
