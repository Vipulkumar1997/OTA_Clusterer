The Business Class seats can be reclined to a 180-degree fully flat position. Located on the aisle side, passengers do not have to worry about disturbing or being disturbed by other passengers. Each side is equipped with a big table, a special shoe rack, a personal compartment, a universal PC power socket, a USB port, a 17-inch touch screen monitor, and a “Do Not Disturb” lamp that the passengers can turn on whenever they want to rest without disruptions.

All Nippon Airways History


The journey of All Nippon Airways (ANA) began on 27 December 1952. Its first flight service, however, was operated in February 1953 using a helicopter. That is why ANA was formerly known as Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane (NH). On 15 December 1953, NH started its first cargo carriage from Osaka to Tokyo using de Havilland Dove aircraft, JA 5008. The flight became the first flight operated by a Japanese pilot after World War II. ANA operated its first passenger carriage on 1 February 1954, using a de Havilland Heron aircraft. In 1955, NH began to operate its flight service using Douglas DC-3 with a route expansion from Northern Kyushu to Sapporo.

ANA experienced a growth spur throughout the 1960s. In 1961, ANA added the Vickers Visvount aircraft and the Fokker F27 to its fleet. A year later, ANA merged with Fujita Airline, raising the company’s capital to ¥4.65 billion. In 1965, ANA introduced jets Boeing 727 to serve the Tokyo – Sapporo route. Still in the same year, ANA became the first Japanese airline to operate a homegrown turboprop aircraft, the YS-11, which replaced the Convair 440 aircraft, to serve domestic routes. Years later in 1969, ANA started using Boeing 737 aircraft.

In the period of 1964 – 1973, ANA began using jets. In May 1964, ANA started using Boeing 727 and Boeing 727-100 aircraft — the first jets that it owned. At the time, more than 1,000 aircraft had been sold and used around the world. In 1969, ANA introduced the Boeing 737-200 aircraft and its services. Throughout time, ANA has continued to operate its flight using Boeing aircraft. Today, the airline owns 179 aircraft in its fleet, which consists of 16 Boeing 737-700 aircraft, two Boeing 737-700 ER aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 29 Boeing 767-300 aircraft, 26 Boeing 767-300ER aircraft, 16 Boeing 777-200 aircraft, nine Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, seven Boeing 777-300 aircraft, 22 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, 35 Boeing 787-8 aircraft and nine Boeing 787-9 aircraft.

While its domestic flight service was growing, until 1986, ANA’s international flight service had been limited to providing charter flights to nearby countries.  Nevertheless, soon enough on 3 March 1986, ANA operated a scheduled international flight from Guam to Tokyo. Flights to Los Angeles and Washington D.C. followed at the end of the year. ANA then also signed a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carrier’s new flights to Narita.

With the slogan of “Inspiration for Japan”, today, ANA employs 20,000 people. The airline’s main hubs are Narita International Airport and Kansai International Airport, while its domestic hubs are Tokyo International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Centrair Chubu International Airport and New Chitose Airport. The airline, which has received the 5-Star World Airline Rating award from Skytrax for five consecutive years, flies to 111 domestic and 54 international destinations.
