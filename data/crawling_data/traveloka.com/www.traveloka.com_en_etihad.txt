Each passenger can choose from three main courses, such as Chicken Biryani, Lamb Casserole, or Navratan Korma.





Business Class


Business Class in Etihad Airways is divided into two types: Business Class and Business Studio. In Business Studio, passengers get a different business class experience, presented through an innovative layout and comfortable fully flat beds measuring up to 6 feet and 8 inches with multifunction features. On A380 aircraft, there is also an upper deck between First and Business Class which seats up to six passengers; each seat is fitted with seatbelts.




In-flight Meal

The in-flight meal menu in Etihad Airways Business Class is inspired by the best upmarket bistros around the world. Besides getting to decide when to eat, passengers will also be served with a highly curated selection of wine.

Etihad Airways History


Etihad Airways is a national airline owned by the United Arab Emirates. It was established in July 2003 by Royal (Amiri) Decree, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who wanted an airline for Abu Dhabi. Darwish Alkhoory, the chief personal pilot for Sheikh Zayed, established the airline with an initial paid-up capital of AED500 million. The services were launched with a ceremonial flight to Al Ain on 5 November 2003. On 12 November 2003, Etihad Airways commenced commercial operations with the launch of services to Beirut. 

In June 2004, the airline placed an US$8 billion order for five units of Boeing 777-300ER and 24 Airbus aircraft, including Airbus A380, which was delivered in December 2014. Four years later in 2008, it was announced at the Farnborough Airshow that Etihad Airways had placed an order for 205 aircraft — the largest aircraft order in commercial aviation history.

As of today, Etihad Airways owns 125 aircraft. Its passenger fleet consists of 35 units of Airbus A320 Family, 25 units of A330 Family, eight units of A340 Family, nine units of Boeing 787-9, 30 units of Boeing 777 Family, and eight units of Airbus A380. The cargo fleet, on the other hand, consists of four units of Airbus A330 Freighter, five units of Boeing 777 Freighter, and one unit of Boeing 747 Freighter Family. Yet, the airline is planning to add 62 units of Airbus A350 — which have already been ordered — and Airbus A320NEO Family, A380, A330F, Boeing 787 Family, 777 Family, and 777F.

Etihad Airways has been experiencing positive growth. The airline’s early orders of various aircraft bore profit in 2011, where it reported its first full-year net profit of US$14 million. In 2011, Etihad Airways announced it had taken a 29.21% stake in Air Berlin, Europe’s sixth largest airline, which was followed by minority stakes in other airlines such as Air Seychelles (40%), Aer Lingus (2.987%), and Virgin Australia (10%). Two years later, James Hogan as the president of the company signed a deal with Aleksander Vučić, First Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, in Belgrade, giving Etihad Airways a 49% stake in the Serbian national carrier Jat Airways. Meanwhile, the Serbian government retained 51% of the shares.

At the 2013 Dubai Airshow, Etihad Airways announced that it was acquiring a 33.3% stake in the Swiss carrier Darwin Airline. Only a year later, the airline agreed to take a 49% stake in the Italian flag carrier Alitalia for an estimated £560, while the Alitalia-CAI shareholders retained 51% of the shares. In May 2016, the management structure of Etihad Airways was reshuffled, appointing James Hogan as the CEO of the airline’s parent company, Etihad Aviation Group. On the other hand, Peter Baumgartner, formerly the airline’s Chief Commercial Officer, took over as Chief Executive Officer of the airline, replacing Hogan.

By 2015, Etihad Airways had established its own airline alliance, Etihad Airways, Partners, that includes Alitalia, Jet Airways, Air Berlin, Niki, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, and Etihad Regional including Virgin Australia. Today, Etihad Airways operates its flight service from the main hub in Khalifa City, Abu Dhabi, near Abu Dhabi International Airport. It was reported that Etihad Airways had spent US$50 million in 2007 to build its new head office and training center.
