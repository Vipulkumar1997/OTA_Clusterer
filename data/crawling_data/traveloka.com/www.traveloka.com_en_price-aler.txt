Why should I set up Price Alerts?










Smart Tracking

Price Alerts serves as a flight price monitoring tool, which tracks the ticket prices and delivers the price trend of your desired flight straight to your inbox.





Flexible Date Option

Haven’t yet decided when to fly? No worries. You can set a date range instead, from 2 to 30 days.











Instant Notifications

You will get alerted as soon as the flight’s prices match your budget, so you will be able to book the right flight at the right time.





Easy to set up

You only need to fill in the details of your desired flight, such as time of departure, number of transits and seat class, and you’ll be all set.
