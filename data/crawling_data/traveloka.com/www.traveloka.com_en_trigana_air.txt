About Trigana Air


Trigana Air (IATA code: IL)
is an Indonesian airline headquartered at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta. The airline is known as one of the private carriers that provide middle range flight service at low cost. Based in Surabaya’s Juanda Airport, Ambon’s Pattimura Airport and Jayapura’s Sentani Airport, Trigana Air operates flight service to 40 destinations around the country, mostly in the eastern region. In Papua, the airline serves flights to such secluded cities as Agimuga, Ewer, Sinak, and Dekai, which are not routes most airlines commonly serve. With the slogan “We Serve You Here, There and Everywhere”, Trigana Air also operates flight routes to big cities in Indonesia. The airline also provides a charter and cargo service. 

Trigana Air offers only one cabin class, which is Economy Class, to serve its exclusively domestic, short-haul flights. Passengers onboard a Trigana Air flight can get themselves occupied by reading the airline’s in-flight magazine, which offers the airline’s latest updates. Snacks are also provided onboard. 

Trigana Air currently operates a fleet of Boeing and ATR aircraft, each with different facilities. Therefore, passengers can also expect different baggage allowance on each aircraft. Passengers traveling on an ATR aircraft, for instance, are generally allowed a free maximum baggage allowance of 10 kg. However, if they fly on such routes as Jayapura – Wamena, Wamena – Dekai, and Jayapura – Dekai, they are allowed to bring up to 15 kg of checked baggage. Trigana Air passengers are also permitted to carry one cabin baggage and one handbag or suitcase. However, it is important to note that the cabin baggage must not be heavier than 7 kg. Meanwhile, passengers traveling on a Boeing aircraft will get a more generous baggage allowance of up to 20 kg. Similar with passengers on an ATR aircraft, they are also allowed to bring a cabin baggage of up to 7 kg onboard.

Trigana Air offers two check-in options for its passengers: offline check-in and online check-in. Offline check-in can be done through the airline’s counters at the airport. Check-in opens from two hours to 45 minutes before departure, hence passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their scheduled flight. Should the passengers fail to come at the designated time, they will not be permitted for air travel with Trigana Air and will be charged a cancellation fee. If the passengers prefer to reschedule, they will be required to rebook the flight. At the time of airport check-in, passengers must present their required travel documents, such as booking evidence, ID card and passport.

Alternatively, passengers who would like to avoid the queue at the check-in counters can take advantage of the airline’s online check-in service. The service allows passengers to reserve space for their checked baggage and select their seats when available. This online check-in service opens 24 hours prior to the flight departure. However, it is very important to remember that passengers are required to print their boarding pass and present it to the airline staff at the airport. Checking in is not the only activity that passengers can do on the Trigana Air online platform. They may also book their flight tickets. All that passengers have to do is select their flight routes and complete the identity form, after which their e-ticket will be sent to their email. Passengers are required to print their e-ticket and present it to the ground crew when checking-in at the airport.

Since 2009, more precisely on April, Trigana Air has been officially classified as Category 1 airline. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation created this system to assess and evaluate all airlines in Indonesia. Among all categories available, Category 1 is the highest. When an airline is categorized as Category 1, it means the airline has met all civil aviation safety requirements. Aside from Trigana Air, there are 12 other Category 1 airlines. The list includes Garuda Indonesia and Sriwijaya Air. This shows that Trigana Air always strives to ensure the safety of its passengers.


Trigana Air History


Trigana Air was founded in 1991, when it also began its flight service. At the time, Trigana Air only owned a fleet of four aircraft, consisting of two Beechcraft Super King Air 200s and two new NBell-412s. Both of these aircraft were locally made by Indonesian Aerospace (IPTN). Originally built to serve chartered flights, Trigana Air secured its first official project in March 1991 from PT Mapindo Parama, who needed a plane to conduct a photography mapping of the forest areas of Indonesia. To serve this project, Trigana Air flew a Super King Air aircraft, becoming the first airline to conduct such project. This success encouraged Trigana Air to add three new aircraft for similar projects. The airline eventually traded its Super King Air with a Fokker F27-600.

Besides photography mapping projects, Trigana Air also served oil transposition projects and offered chartered flights. Its first oil transposition project was conducted in November 1991 in the Thousand Islands for a client named MAXUS Oil. This time, the airline used an NBell-412 SP helicopter, because it was considered as a safer vehicle to transport the company’s logistics. Meanwhile, for charters, the airline provided special flight service for the ASEAN Emergency Assistance (AEA) and SOS Medika to support their medical evacuation projects in several areas in Indonesia—a service it still provides today. 

Eventually, the demand for photography mapping decreased and the airline decided to expand its business scope by providing cargo and passenger carriage service. The increasing demands for travel by air especially to Indonesia’s eastern regions was partly prompted by the discovery of huge business and tourism potential in the region. Proper road access is limited in most of the eastern region, hence air travel becomes the best alternative to reach the area. With this newly discovered opportunity, Trigana Air decided to purchase new aircraft to cater to this new demand.

Therefore, from 1993 to 2000, Trigana Air operated more aircraft variety, which included Twin-Otter DHC-6, Fokker F27, and Pilatus PC-6. The latter was used to carry logistics to 24 areas around Papua. Over time, the airline’s fleet was also modified. In 2000, Trigana Air purchased new ATR72-300 aircraft. Unlike any previous aircraft, this one is able to carry passengers with the maximum capacity of 80 people. During the same time, new flight routes to Nusa Tenggara and Kalimantan were also launched. Then in 2006, 15 years since the airline was founded, its Fokker F27 aircraft was traded for De Havilland DHC-4 Caribou from Canada. 

Along with higher demands, Trigana Air added more new aircraft. In 2010, Trigana Air purchased five units of Boeing 737-200 and introduced some new flight routes to not only the eastern region but also other big cities in the country, such as Jakarta and Surabaya. Trigana Air also launched new flight routes to Kalimantan including to Banjarmasin and Pangkalan Bun.

Today, Trigana Air operates a fleet of 16 aircraft, consisting of seven units of ATR 42-300 aircraft, three units of ATR 72-202 aircraft, three units of Boeing 737-200A, and three units of Boeing 737-300 Freighter aircraft. The ATR 42-300 aircraft has the smallest passengers capacity. It is able to carry only 50 people with a total maximum cargo weight of 4,500 kg. However, the ATR 42-300 also has the best flight endurance among other aircraft in the airline’s fleet. The aircraft is hence used to serve long-haul flights with a duration of up to nine hours. 

Meanwhile, the ATR 72-202 aircraft offers more capacity because it can carry up to 72 passengers with a maximum cargo weight of 7,000 kg, but it is designed for journeys of up to only eight hours. On the other hand, Boeing becomes the airline’s aircraft with the shortest traveling time of only up to six hours. However, the passenger and baggage capacities are way bigger than that of other aircraft. These Boeing aircraft can carry up to 114 passengers with a maximum cargo weight of 12,954 kg.

Since its establishment, Trigana Air has worked with different companies for a wide variety of projects. Between 1992 to 1993, the airline provided a charter fleet of Twin-Otter DHC-6 aircraft to carry passengers and cargo for PT Freeport Indonesia. Between 1994 to 1996, PT Jayanti Group hired the airline to access Benjina Island, and in 1995, the offshore Sabah Oil Company hired the airline as a means of transport to reach Sabah, Malaysia. From 1993 to 1997, Conoco Oil Company used the service of the airline, who used the Fokker F-27 and the Super King Air B200 aircraft, to access Matak Island. Then between 1996 and 1998, the airline established a joint operation of the F-28 aircraft with Mandala Air. Finally, since 1993 until now, it has worked with the Irian Bhakti logistics depot to carry logistics to 24 districts in Papua using the Twin-Otter DHC-6, Fokker F-27, and Pilatus PC-6 aircraft.
