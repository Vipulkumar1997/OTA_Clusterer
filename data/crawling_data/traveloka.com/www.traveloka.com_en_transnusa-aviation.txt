About TransNusa Aviation


TransNusa Aviation (IATA code: 8B)
, is a subsidiary airline of PT TransNusa Air Services. Operating as TransNusa Aviation Mandiri, the airline is more commonly known as TransNusa. Established 12 years ago in 2005, TransNusa commenced its first flight in August of the same year. With a headquarter at Jalan Palapa 7, Oebobo, Kupang, Nusa Tenggara Timur, TransNusa operates its flight service from two main hubs, which are El Tari International Airport in Kupang and Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali. TransNusa’s network is dominated by domestic routes, with a focus on the eastern part of Indonesia, mainly Nusa Tenggara and southern Sulawesi. This focus is portrayed through the airline’s slogan, “Beyond Airline in Nusa Tenggara”.

To create more seamless flight experience and expand its route network in Indonesia, TransNusa has codeshare agreements with other airlines, such as Aviastar Mandiri, Indonesia Air Transport, Nusantara Air Charter, Sriwijaya Air, and Trigana Air Service. TransNusa also has strategic partnerships with Aviastar, Indonesia Air Transport, Sriwijaya Air, and Riau Airlines to connect destinations in Bali and Nusa Tenggara. Besides providing commercial flight service, TransNusa also offers charter flight services and special flight services for medical evacuation. Charter flight services are usually booked by companies in East Indonesia to carry their oil and mining production.

Operating mostly short-haul flights to destinations in eastern Indonesia, TransNusa’s fleet consists of seven smaller aircraft, such as the British Aerospace 146-100, Fokker 50, Fokker 70, and ATR 72-600. With this consideration, TransNusa only offers flights in the Economy Class, which is further categorized into ten subclasses. However, TransNusa always aims to give the best service to its passengers, while putting safety and comfort as its top priorities. All TransNusa passengers are also allowed to carry up to 5 kg of cabin baggage. In addition, each passenger is also entitled to 15 kg of checked baggage allowance. Special for passengers traveling to Makassar, checked baggage allowance is 20 kg per passenger. Meanwhile, passengers traveling to Larantuka, Rote, Lewoleba, Sabu, Atambua, and Ruteng get a 10 kg baggage allowance.

All checked baggage must be dropped at the check-in counter, which opens from two hours to 45 minutes before departure. Passengers are also required to be present at the boarding gate at least 30 minutes before the scheduled flight. Alternatively, passengers can check-in online via TransNusa’s website, which will be closed four hours before departure.

Meanwhile, throughout the flight, passengers can enjoy a complimentary in-flight magazine, which contains information about flight schedules, latest corporate news and social activities, as well as tourism-related content. Passengers will also be provided with an in-flight meal service, which consists of mineral water and bread. This in-flight meal service is available in all flight routes, making the flight journey become more enjoyable for the passengers.

To reward its most valuable passengers, TransNusa offers a frequent flyer program called VIP. Passengers will automatically be a VIP member after flying with TransNusa for ten times. VIP members are entitled to exclusive facilities that cannot be enjoyed by regular passengers, such as free additional 10 kg of baggage allowance, as well as access to TransNusa’s airport lounge at El Tari International Airport in Kupang. The airport lounge is built to provide maximum comfort for the airline’s most loyal passengers, complete with facilities such as television, comfortable couches, and a great selection of foods. VIP members will also get booking priority, which can be beneficial during holiday seasons.


TransNusa Aviation History


When TransNusa first operated in August 2005, the airline teamed up with Trigana Air Service to serve flights to three destinations in East Indonesia, which includes Waingapu, Tambolaka, and Lewoleba using a fleet of ATR 42-300 aircraft. During the same year, new flight routes to Alor, Ende, Maumere, and Ruteng were also introduced. In the process, TransNusa also teamed up with other airlines, such as Riau Airlines, Mandala Airlines, and Pelita Air. Partnership with Riau Airlines includes the allocation of Fokker 50 aircraft to operate flight services to the Nusa Tenggara area. TransNusa also leased a Boeing aircraft from Trigana Air to launch new flight routes from Kupang to Surabaya through Denpasar, as well as from Kupang to Makassar. The Boeing aircraft was later replaced with Fokker F28-4000 aircraft.

Besides offering commercial flight service, TransNusa also offers charter flight services and a holiday package. The airline has worked together with various tourism companies in Indonesia, especially ones in the eastern region. TransNusa once helped Wakatobi Dive Resort to provide a charter flight service by operating two ATR42 aircraft once in every ten days to carry foreign passengers from Denpasar to visit Wakatobi. TransNusa had also teamed up with Nihiwatu Resort in Sumba. At the time, the airline was responsible for carrying the resort’s customers from Denpasar to Tambolaka.

The year 2007 was an eventful year for TransNusa. During this time, TransNusa teamed up with Mandala Airlines. The airline served as a ticketing agent for Mandala Airlines, as well as a feeder for one of the Mandala Airlines’ aircraft, which was Airbus A320. This partnership has connected East Nusa Tenggara with Mandala Airlines’ routes network through Jakarta and Surabaya. During the same year, TransNusa also worked together with the West Nusa Tenggara government to introduce new flight routes from Mataram to Sumbawa and Mataram to Bima. TransNusa had also partnered with the local government of Ngada to introduce new flight routes, such as Kupang–Bajawa and Bajawa–Kupang.

Moreover, TransNusa’s airport lounge at the El Tari International Airport in Kupang was also built in 2007. With Abacus, TransNusa launched an online ticket reservation system, which was the first in East Nusa Tenggara. This breakthrough allowed TransNusa’s passengers to book flight tickets more seamlessly. TransNusa also introduced its in-flight magazine for the first time in 2007. Published once in three months, the magazine contains information about flight schedules, latest corporate news and social activities, as well as tourism-related content.

TransNusa was so eager to improve the tourism industry in the Nusa Tenggara area that it launched NTT Corner, which is an information center where people can learn about all the tourism potential in East Nusa Tenggara. In addition, TransNusa also launched a special program called NTT Fun Trip as a reward for students in Kupang.

In 2011, six years after it was established, TransNusa was given the Air Operator Certificate. Issued by a national aviation institution, this certificate became an official approval for the airline to operate its aircraft for commercial purposes. During the same year, TransNusa also added three more new Fokker 50 aircraft in order to improve its flight service. 

Throughout 2013 and 2014, TransNusa operated its charter flight service for several companies such as Pearl Mubadala for an offshore drilling in Natuna, Lundin BV, Chevron Indonesia, Premier Oil Tuna, and Star Energy for scheduled charter flight to Anambas Sea. In 2014, TransNusa added new units of ATR 600 aircraft to its fleet. At the same time, the airline also purchased its first Fokker 70 aircraft. Today, TransNusa operates a fleet of seven aircraft, which consists of Fokker 50, Fokker 70, ATR 42-600, and BAe 146-100.
