About
Located 20 km off Singapore’s south coast, Batam is the largest city in Riau Islands Province,
Indonesia
. It is the third most-populated city in Sumatera after
Medan
and
Palembang
.

Tourism has a strong impact towards Batam economic development. In 2010, for example, local government worked together with several hotels, resorts and tourism objects to initiate a program called “Visit Batam 2010-Experience it” as a way to promote local tourism. As a result, this city welcomed more than 1 million international tourists.

For those who love shopping, Batam is a perfect destination for you. This city is commonly known to own many imported goods such as low to premium fashion as well as technology products. If you are a tech enthusiast, you can easily find various smartphones, cameras and laptops sold in all price ranges.

The native inhabitants of Batam are the Malays (Malay People, Melayu), an ethnic group that is also known as “Orang Selat” (literally “Strait People”). It is predicted that these people have lived in Batam since 231 AC.

In the 14th century, Batam was ruled under the power of the Temasek Empire or what is now known as Singapore. Years after that, power to rule Batam shifted to the hands of Malay kingdom of Riau before it united with Indonesia.

As a city once ruled by Singapore, the local government planned to build Batam as an industrial city or the “Singapore of Indonesia” after the colonial era. Since then, this city has become the base for imported goods, logistics, natural resources such as crude oil and many more.

How to Get There

There are several ways to reach Batam:
