How we have helped?

Here are what our partners say.









Rini Anggraini

Corporate Director of Revenue & Distribution of Tauzia Hotel




"So far we've registered 42 hotels in 14 different cities and counting.  And we're also very happy interacting with the Market Manager. They always respond to problems in a timely manner. At the same time TERA has also been very useful to us, only we hope to get more thorough insight from their report. We will definitely continue working with Traveloka for many years to come."










Lee Kam Boon

Manager of Hotel Transit Kuala Lumpur


"Traveloka had helped in increasing our OTA market and created the much needed awareness of Hotel Transit to Indonesian market."







Edi Syumardi

Corporate General Manager of Intiwhiz Hospitality Management




"When people question me; What do you need the most to build a sustainable partnership? A beneficial cooperation based on equality in order to grow together, thatâ€™s how we worked with Traveloka."
