About Kalstar Aviation


Kalstar Aviation (IATA code: KD)
is an Indonesian regional airline headquartered in Serpong, Tangerang. The airline was founded by experienced aviation professional Andi Masyhur in 2000, and during the early years of its operation called the city of Samarinda in the island of Kalimantan home.

The airline officially became a scheduled airline in 2007, following its purchase of the French ATR 42-300 to serve its inaugural route from Samarinda to Tarakan and Nunukan. The mid-level company grew so quickly that, by 2013, it had already served 1 million passengers to various destinations in the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan, Java and Nusa Tenggara. Today, Kalstar Aviation serves more than 95 domestic Indonesia routes and 22 regional routes, becoming one of the airline companies that dominate the Eastern Indonesia market.

Kalstar Aviation uses four types of aircraft in its 13-aircraft fleet. They are ATR 42-300/500, ATR 72-500/600, Embraer 195 and Boeing 737-500, each with its own capacity. The ATR 42-300/500, can carry around 48 to 50 passengers, while the ATR 72-500/600 can carry 72 passengers. Boeing 737-300 and 737-500, can each carry 138 and 125 passengers respectively, while the Embraer E-190 and Embraer E-195 can carry up to 108 and 120 passengers respectively.

Kalstar Aviation has a vision of becoming the best airline in its class in terms of service, flight route and passenger loyalty. In order to fulfill this vision, the airline offers a range of services for its passengers before, during and after their flights. The airline company believes that good service is what ensures passenger loyalty, which, in turn, will result in growing profitability. 

Kalstar Aviation may not be a full-service airline, but it offers services often unexpected of similar airlines in its class. With “Fly Smart with Us” slogan, the airline strives to provide its passengers with flexibility and comfort. Through its Easy Connection feature,  passengers can arrange a connecting flight easily, while its Convenience Scheduling feature allows passengers to conveniently schedule their flights. 

Operating with ATR and Boeing aircraft, the airline offers only Economy Class flights However, the airline complies with the industry’s mid-market playbook, offering comfortable seats and food on every flight. Each seat, covered in soft leather, has been designed to provide enough legroom, and each flight comes with an in-flight meal of snacks or main course, depending on the flight route and duration. Full set meals are served only on long-haul flights. 

There is no in-flight entertainment facility onboard Kalstar Aviation flights, but passengers can find the airline’s in-flight magazine Kalstar in the seat pocket in front of their seat. Kalstar offers travel features and news, information and news about the aviation industry, as well as Kalstar’s own latest corporate news. Additionally, Kalstar Aviation also offers an in-flight shopping facility, where guests can find interesting products such as branded perfume and makeup kit, among others. 

All Kalstar Aviation passengers are provided with a free baggage facility. Kalstar Aviation passengers flying with Boeing 737 are allowed a checked baggage weighing no more than 20 kg, while those flying with ATR 42, can check-in only 10 kg of baggage. Passengers are also allowed a cabin baggage. Those flying with ATR 42 can carry a maximum of 5 kg, while those traveling with Boeing 737 can bring a maximum of 7 kg onboard a Kalstar Aviation flight. 

Being a medium service airline, Kalstar Aviation offers tickets in mid-level prices. This means, passengers flying with the airline can expect to pay less than they would when flying with full service airlines. However, the ticket prices are still higher than those offered by low-cost carriers. 

Kalstar Aviation passengers are advised to check-in between two hours to 45 minutes before their departure. Otherwise, they will not be able to board the flights. If a passenger misses the check-in period, he/she can ask for a refund, but will only be granted 10% of the original ticket price. Passengers can submit their refund request up to seven (7) days after their departure date. If the passengers fail to submit their refund request within seven (7) days after their departure date, the airline will not process their refund request.

In order to provide more convenience for its passengers, Kalstar Aviation has launched its own app called Kalstar Mobile. The app allows passengers to not only see departure and arrival schedules, but also to complete their check-in process. This means passengers can check themselves in even when they are still on their way to the airport — no need to queue at the check-in counters in the airport anymore. 

Additionally, Kalstar Aviation accepts only e-tickets, and so all Kalstar Aviation ticket reservations must be completed online. Passengers can purchase Kalstar Aviation tickets through the airline’s own official website or through affiliate websites. Passengers need only book their ticket and fill in their personal information during the booking process.

The logo of Kalstar Aviation is inspired by the hornbill. The hornbill is the mascot of West Kalimantan — a nod to the airline’s Kalimantan origin — and a sacred bird of Kalimantan’s famed Dayak tribe. The Kalimantan hornbill is a rare, unique species — it flies high, and when it does, it sings beautifully.


Kalstar Aviation History


The lack of airline service in Kalimantan prompted the establishment Kalstar Aviation. Founded by experienced aviation industry professional Andi Masyhur in 2000, Kalstar Aviation was headquartered in Samarinda, Kalimantan. However, the airline, which was founded under the name of PT Kalstar Nusantara and with partnership with a national private airline company, is now headquartered in Serpong, Tangerang, with a main hub in Supadio Airport, West Kalimantan.

PT Kalstar Aviation officially became a scheduled airline in November 2007. In its early operation, the airline used exclusively ATR 42-300 aircraft from France. The airline’s first aircraft, called KSE, was bought on 22 September 2008 and immediately served the airline’s first flight from Samarinda to Tarakan and Nunukan. Two years later, in 2010, the airline added another ATR 42 to its fleet. 

The year 2013 marked a great milestone for Kalstar Aviation. The airline had flown more than 1 million passengers, most of them being from the islands of Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara. For an airline operating mostly in Eastern Indonesia, this is a great achievement, as it showcases the airline’s ability to grab the untapped market. In addition to that, the airline had had but one accident since its establishment in 2000. The airline has never recorded any other accident since 21 December 2015 to this day, which shows its great commitment to passenger safety.

Kalstar Aviation flies to three destination categories: Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara and Java, which is the airline’s newest destination. Hence, the airline serves flights to only airports in major cities on Java, such as the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, the Husein Sastranegara International Airport in Bandung, the Juanda International Airport in Surabaya, and the Achmad Yani International Airport in Semarang, which is the newest destination.

On Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara, however, the airline offers many more destinations. Kalstar Aviation flies to Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport in Balikpapan, Syamsudin Noor Airport in Banjarmasin, Kalimarau Airport in Berau, Ketapang Airport, Kota Baru Gusti Syamsir Alam Airport, Malinau, Robert Atty Bessing Airport, Melak Melalan Airport, Nunukan Airport, Pangkalan Bun Iskandar Airport, Supadio Airport in Pontianak, Putussibau Pangusuma Airport, Termindung Airport in Samarinda, Sampit Airport, Sintang Regency Sintang Airport, Tanjung Selor Tanjung Harapan Airport, and Juwata International Airport in Tarakan. On Bali and Nusa Tenggara, KalStar Aviation provides flights to Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Frans Seda Airport in Maumere, El Tari Airport in Kupang, and H. Hasan Aroebusman Airport in Ende.

The airline’s focus on serving flights to Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara is not without reason. First, there are few airlines serving this route, and second, the region promises huge market potential. Currently, both the government and private sectors are pushing infrastructure development and investment in this region. Therefore, while the airline is not a big player on Java, it is in Eastern Indonesia, becoming one of the promising airlines in Indonesia. 

Kalstar Aviation serves not only commercial passenger flight, it also offers a cargo service. Named Star Cargo, the service has been around since 2001, becoming one of the chosen cargo delivery services in Kalimantan and contributing to the island’s economic growth. In 2012, Star Cargo expanded its delivery network to include the entire Indonesian archipelago. Star Cargo has its own fleets of not only aircraft, but also trucks and ships to offer a complete cargo service. 

Among the packages offered by Star Cargo are same-day delivery service (Hari Ini Kirim Hari Ini Sampai - HIS), two-day delivery service (Hari Ini Kirim Besok Sampai - HIB), express delivery (Pelayanan Express - EXP) and cargo service (Pelayanan Cargo - REG). This range of services allows customers to handle anything from document and packages, to heavy cargo, cargo of oil and mining companies, logistics and distribution, and custom clearance. The cargo service also accepts requests for movers. Meanwhile, customers using the cargo express service can take advantage of its door-to-door, door-to-port, port-to-door and port-to-port delivery.
