Asiana Airlines History


Asiana Airlines was founded by Kumho Asiana Group on 17 February 1988. The airline started operating its flight in December 1988 using a Boeing 737 Classic aircraft, flying from Busan to Gwangju. In 1989, Asiana Airlines introduced its regular flight service to Jeju, Gwangju, and Daegu. Later that year, the airline also opened an international charter service from Sendai to Japan.

In the 1990s, Asiana Airlines operated its new international flight to Tokyo, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka. At the time, the airline had already owned nine units of Boeing 747-700 aircraft, 10 units of Boeing 767-300 aircraft, and eight units of Boeing 737-400 aircraft. In early 1991, it was announced that Asiana Airlines had expanded its international flight routes to Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taipei. Asiana Airlines also introduced a transpacific flight to Los Angeles, which started to operate on December of the same year, using a Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft. In 1993, Asiana Airlines started its flight service to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. The airline continued to expand its network to Vienna, Brussels, and Honolulu, which were introduced in the mid-1990s. 

Asiana Airlines also began to focus on being an environmentally friendly company since the mid-1990s. One of the efforts done by the airlines is by completely banning in-flight smoking and cigarette sales in 1995. The company was even recognized for being the first environmentally friendly company within the service industry by the Korean Ministry of Environment. Some of Asiana Airlines’ other environmental initiatives include an emissions measurement and reduction system, reducing pollution from ground facilities, and partnering with the Rainforest Alliance to serve coffee which beans are grown and harvested on farms that follow sustainable practices.

Since the 2000s, Asiana Airlines has put its focus on developing its long-haul flight service and fleet modernization. In 2004, Asiana Airlines added Airbus A330 and Boeing 777-200ER aircraft to its fleet and expanded its route to mainland China. As of July 2017, the airline’s fleet size is amounting up to 82 aircraft.

On 28 January 2003, Asiana Airlines officially became a member of Star Alliance, the largest aviation alliance in the world. This allows Asiana Airlines to expand its network further by adding more international flight routes to its service. Currently, Asiana Airlines serves 79 international routes, covering 65 cities across 23 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. As of December 2013, the airline operates a total of 90 transpacific flights per week.
