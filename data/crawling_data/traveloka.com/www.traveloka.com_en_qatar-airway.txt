About Qatar Airways


Qatar Airways (IATA code: QR)
is a global airline well-known for its prime services and comfortable facilities. Qatar Airways’ main office is located in Doha, with several local offices spread across various countries. Since 2014, this airline has used Hamad International Airport as the hub for most of its daily flights.

Qatar Airways isa state-owned airline which was formed in 1993, and was reformed in 1997 to become one of the best airlines in the world. The airline has a slogan “Going Places Together” and has been successful in developing its service quality, while growing its number of fleets and destinations. Qatar Airways’ success story has been cemented by the many awards it has received.

From 2011 to 2016, Qatar Airways had consistently held the top two spots in the world's best airline ranking by Skytrax. The airline held the first place in 2011, 2012, and 2015. In 2016, Qatar Airways also earned other awards from Skytrax, which included World's Best Business Class, Best Business Class Airport Lounge, and Best Airline Service in the Middle East. Qatar Airways’ frequent flyer program has also earned a Freddie Awards twice, in 2006 and 2007.

Qatar Airways provides a 50-kg baggage allowance for its First Class passengers, 40 kg for Business Class, and 30 kg for Economy Class. Passengers in First and Business Class are also allowed to bring two carry-on bags into the cabin, with a total maximum weight of 15 kg. Meanwhile, Economy Class passengers are allowed one cabin bag with a maximum weight of 7 kg. In addition, passengers are allowed to bring a small handbag into the cabin.

Aside from the generous baggage allowance, Qatar Airways provides in-flight entertainment in all of its cabin, called Oryx One. It offers more than 3,000 titles of movies, songs, and games, which can be played on the passenger’s personal monitor and headset. As an alternative, a creative education kit is also available for child passengers. USB ports are available in each seat, making it possible for passengers to use their gadget for a long time. 

Qatar Airways advises its passengers to arrive at the airport three hours prior to departure. To avoid a long check-in queue at the airport counter, passengers can also check-in online from 48 hours to 90 minutes before departure. However, passengers are still suggested to arrive at the airport three hours before departure to go through airport security, immigration and boarding.


Qatar Airways History


Qatar Airways began as a small airline in the Persian Gulf country of Qatar. This airline was formed on 22 November 1993, and began its operation on 20 January 1994. In the beginning, the airline was owned by the Qatar royal family. At the time, the airline only had four units of aircraft, bought second-hand from other airlines, to serve only regional routes in the Middle East.

It was not until 1997, when Akbar Al Baker assumed the role of CEO of Qatar Airways, that the airline experienced a reformation to become an international airline offering the best service. One of the reformation strategies was to add more fleets and destinations. From 1997 to 2003, Qatar Airways added more than 40 new fleets. The airline also added new routes to Jakarta, Indonesia and Basra, Iraq. At the time, half of Qatar Airways’ stocks were owned by the government, while another half was owned by the private sector.

In 2003, Qatar Airways became the first airline to pass the new stringent IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). A year later, the airline was formally recognized as a world's five-star airline from Skytrax — a crucial moment which marked Qatar Airways' milestone.

A year later, in 2004, Qatar Airways’ had flown to more than 54 cities. In the following year, the airline opened a new Doha – Osaka route and bought 50 new Airbus A340-600 jets. As a result, Qatar Airways successfully carried 5.6 million passengers in the fiscal year of 2004 – 2005, and increased its number of passengers to 6.3 million in the following fiscal year. 

In 2006, Qatar Airways received 50 new Airbus A340-600 high gross weights version, which offer higher fuel capacity for long-haul flights. This type of aircraft can be used to fly from Doha to the east coast of the United States without a stop, flying above Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. The airline also became the official airline of the 15th Asian Games held in Doha in 2006.

One year later, two new routes to Newark and Washington, D.C. were launched. Qatar Airways also ordered 32 units of new Boeing 777 aircraft to carry even more passengers. Along with the additional routes and fleets, Qatar Airways also improved their service quality. As a result, the airline continued to win many awards, both regionally and internationally.
Qatar Airways became the first civil airline in the world to use gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel in 2009. The aircraft which was used to try the fuel was an Airbus 340-600, flying on a Gatwick London – Doha route. The airline then tried its first flight to Melbourne in the same year. 

In June 2010, Qatar Airways opened its first routes to South America, particularly to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires. In this year, Qatar Airways started operating its 20th Boeing 777, making its fleet consist of a total of 86 aircraft.

The growth of Qatar Airways continued until it reached a new milestone in 2011, when the airline opened its 100th destination and operated its 100th aircraft. The 100th destination was Aleppo in Syria, while the 100th fleet was a Boeing 777-200.

In 2012, Qatar Airways became the first airline to acquire the complete aircraft recovery equipment. The new state-of-the-art kit was worth US$ 3.2 million. It can be used to recover the biggest passenger jet used at the moment, the Airbus A380. It is also transportable, enabling Qatar Airways to recover their aircraft from any incident site.

Moreover, 2012 was also marked with a new route from Doha to Perth and an exhibition of Boeing 787 Dreamliner owned by Qatar Airways in England. Qatar Airways was the first airline in the Middle East to own this type of wide-body aircraft. By the end of 2012, the airline has effectively operated three units of Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 

In 2013, Qatar Airways became the first airline in the Middle East to join a world airline alliance,
one
world®. The alliance operates more than 14,000 flights in more than 1,000 cities each day. Qatar Airways passengers can enjoy the facilities offered by the alliance. For instance, those with a Gold or Platinum Privilege Club card can enjoy the
one
world® airport lounges in more than 600 airports around the world.

After becoming a member of
one
world®, Qatar Airways launched its first all-business class flight route from Doha to London. The aircraft used was an Airbus A319LR jet with 40 business class seats. The launch marked Qatar Airways’ commitment to providing top business class service.

Later in 2014, the Government of Qatar took over 50% of Qatar Airways’ stocks from the private stockholders. Consequently, since that time, Qatar Airways has been fully owned by the government.

In the same year, Qatar Airways launched a mobile application in order to make the information about Qatar Airways more accessible via mobile phone. One year later, Qatar Airways’ popularity rose, and it became the first airline in the world to have 10 million fans’ likes on its official Facebook account.

In December 2015, Qatar Airways became the first airline in the world to use Airbus A350 jets to travel to three continents. The third continent it visited was America, where it launched a branding campaign with the slogan “Going Places Together”, which has been used until today.

In July 2016, Qatar Airways reported that they gained the biggest profit in their own history, which was QAR 3 billion during the fiscal year of 2015 – 2016. In the same fiscal year, the airline employed at least 40,000 employees around the world, with 25,000 people directly under the Qatar Airways management. During that year, Qatar Airways added 14 new destinations and 19 fleets, including more Airbus A350 aircraft which were then operated by Qatar Airways for its newly opened Doha – Adelaide route.

Due to the massive growth throughout the span of 18 years, as of January 2017, Qatar Airways has had 192 fleets and 166 destinations. Yet, the airline has planned to operate eight new routes, which are to Las Vegas (US), Tabuk and Yanbu (Saudi Arabia), Canberra (Australia), Dublin (Ireland), Medan (Indonesia), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and Santiago (Chile).
