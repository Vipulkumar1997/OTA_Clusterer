About Bangkok Airways


Bangkok Airways (IATA code: PG)
was built in 1968 under the name Sahakol Air before changing its brand in 1986. This airline is Thailand’s first airline company. Bangkok Airways is headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand, with 35 fleets serving 12 domestic flights and 15 international flights. Skytrax, the airline ranking company, has consistently placed Bangkok Airways in the top rank, currently giving it a four-star rating. The latest Skytrax award named Bangkok Airways as The World’s Best Regional Airline 2016 and Best Regional Airline in Asia 2016.

On its 36th birthday in 2004, Bangkok Airways launched its slogan, Asia’s Boutique Airline: Exclusive Service to Exotic Gems, along with the campaign to establish its new brand. The main objective was to position Bangkok Airways as a credible and trustworthy airline with the modern and trendy character of a boutique. Adopting the idea of a boutique, a small specialty shop catering to a specific market, Bangkok Airways aims to offer not only the best personalized service for passengers, but also more exotic and cultural destinations. This can been seen through every Bangkok Airways’ aircraft that is tailored in a modern and recognizable way. The aircrafts are decorated with colorful liveries of the various exotic and cultural destinations, adding to the airline’s trendy and boutique feel.

The implementation of the new regulations regarding the Thai Government Open-Sky Policy provides an opportunity for many new airlines to join the business. To secure a solid foothold in the ever-changing air industry, this boutique campaign emphasizes and expands upon Bangkok Airways’ position as a legacy carrier known for pioneering private airline flights to the Kingdom of Thailand. By offering a variety of services in all categories ranging from boutique lounges, boutique airports, appetizing in-flight meals, a fleet of new airplanes and passengers’ friendly service, Bangkok Airways has certainly distinguish itself from its competitors.

Bangkok Airways has three private airports with the quality of boutique airports in three different provinces: Samui, Sukhothai, and Trat. Each airport has a unique architecture and is designed to be integrated with nature and culture surrounding them. Samui Airport is located in the middle of the tropical garden and coconut groves of Koh Samui. Sukhothai Airport is located among calm rice paddies, reflecting the traditional Thai architecture. The Trat Airport highlights the essence of the province’s natural environment. These unique architectures are based on the boutique airport philosophy that Bangkok Airways is always proud of.

As its core value, Bangkok Airways adopts 4C for Communication, Coordination, Cooperation, and Contribution. Communication covers Bangkok Airways’ commitment to enhancing its relationship with customers and provide them with the best understanding through a smooth exchange of information and ideas. Coordination encompases the airline’s commitment to mutual cooperation among employees to establish an efficient system. Cooperation is a commitment to support each other while achieving the airline’s goals, while Contribution solidifies the commitment to work effectively by prioritizing tasks and obligations to provide benefits for the company and each employee.

Safety has always been Bangkok Airways' primary concern, hence the airline continually conducts a maintenance check on all of its aircraft fleets that grace the skies. As a result, in February 2017, Bangkok Airways received the Air Operation Certificate (AOC) from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand. The certificate was given to award the airline’s commitment in ensuring the security and safety of not only its passengers but also its partners and employees. To get the certificate, Bangkok Airways had to pass five stages of inspection and measurement, along with a review and examination by the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand. This achievement has placed Bangkok Airways as the first company in Thailand to receive the new certificate of air transport services. This also proves that the airline’s management system and operational control are of the highest standards, consistent with the company’s mission to maintain the international standards of air transport safety.

Bangkok Airways offers FlyerBonus, a frequent flyer program with special promotions which allows passengers to collect points from specified activities and redeem them for award flights and hotel stays.

During the flight, Blue Ribbon Club passengers will be pampered by spacious and comfortable seating as well as a wider legroom, allowing them to catch up on work with ease or simply relax. Diverse menus will be served, ranging from authentic Thai food and other Asian flavors to Western-style meals, complete with complimentary wine and champagne. FlyerBonus members will also receive extra mileage points when flying with Blue Ribbon Club.

Bangkok Airways has two main flight classes: Economy Class and Business Class, each with different privileges. The affordable Economy Class provides the passengers with comfortable adjustable seats, while in Business Class, passengers can take advantage of the empty middle seat to set a table or an armrest.

Bangkok Airways History


Bangkok Airways started its debut as an air transport service in 1968 with the name Sahakol Air. The company became the first private airline in Thailand. In the beginning, Sahakol Air’s first aircraft, a nine-passenger double-prop engine called Trade Wind, flew for charter purposes. The first regular charters were made by American charter company OICC, United States Operation Mission (USOM), and a number of other organizations engaged in oil and natural-gas exploration in the Gulf of Thailand.

Today, due to the rapid growth of tourism and business investments in Thailand, air transportation has become an increasingly important aspect contributing to both the Kingdom's economic growth and its infrastructure development, supporting the country’s goal to becoming a major destination capable of hosting several million overseas visitors per year.

To fulfill the increasing demands for air transportation, Bangkok Airways officially began its full operations as the country's first privately-owned domestic airline in 1986, initially offering scheduled flights from Bangkok to Krabi, Korat, and Surin. Presently, Bangkok Airways has obtained permits to operate scheduled flights to serve more than 20 routes covering nearly all major resort destinations in Thailand. 

Additionally, the airline has also obtained permits to fly internationally to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives.In April 1989, Bangkok Airways set up its own airport on Koh Samui. This airport allows direct flights from the island to Chiang Mai, Hong Kong, Krabi, Pattaya, Phuket, and Singapore. The company also opened its second airport in Sukhothai Province in 1996 and its third airport in Trat Province in March 2003 to serve foreign tourists who want to visit Ko Chang. 

In March 2017, Trat Airport received the EIA Monitoring Awards 2016 as an air transport organization who has followed the environmental regulations for four years in a row. The award was given by General Surasak Karnjanarat, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, and was received by Vice President of Bangkok Airways, Narongchai Tanadchangsaeng. 

The airline started a new breakthrough by adding Boeing 717s in its fleet in 2000. Previously, Bangkok Airways aircrafts relied on propeller engines, mainly ATR-72. In fact, the Fokker 100 had also been used for a short time. In 2004, the airline added other jets, including the Airbus A320, as one of its best aircrafts, and in 2006, it announced it would add wide-body jets to serve flights to destinations like London, India, and Japan. Bangkok Airways’ fleet currently consists of nine Airbus 320, 12 Airbus 319, five ATR 72-500, and eight ATR 72-600.
