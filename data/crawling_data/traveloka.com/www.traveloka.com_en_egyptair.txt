EgyptAir History


EgyptAir’s journey began when Alan Muntz, the chairman of Airwork airline, visited Egypt in 1931. Muntz had wanted to open a new airline and the government of Egypt granted a permission. A new airline called Misr Airwork was then born in 1932, but it didn’t start operating until 1933. About decade later during World War II, the Egyptian government took over the airline and changed its name to Misr Airlines, which then was changed again to Misrair in 1946. 

Following the formation of the United Arab Republic by Egypt and Syria, Misrair changed its name to United Arab Airlines (UAA) in 1958. Then in 1971, following the split of Egypt and Syria, the airline changed its name yet again to its current name EgyptAir. The airline inherited UAA’s staff, equipment, assets and liabilities, but in 2002, the airline underwent a major corporate re-engineering, where its structure was changed from a governmental organization to a holding company with subsidiaries.

Since the restructure, EgyptAir has achieved many certificates from international bodies. In 2004, EgyptAir became the first airline in Africa to have an IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). Four years later, precisely in July 2008, EgyptAir officially became the 21st member of Star Alliance, the biggest global alliance in the world. This has become one of the most important milestones in EgyptAir’s journey, allowing EgyptAir to offer better flight connections and more comfortable travel. Thanks to this, now EgyptAir’s passengers also get an access to dozens of airport lounges worldwide. EgyptAir is the only airline based in the Middle East and North Africa that is part of the Global Star alliance.

In 2009, EgyptAir’s operation at its Cairo International Airport hub were overhauled due to the inauguration of the new Terminal 3 in April 2009. The airline transferred all its operations to the new terminal which offers double the capacity. Under the Star Alliance “Move Under One Roof” campaign at Cairo Airport, all Star Alliance member carriers moved to the new Terminal 3. In 2010, the airline also overhauled operations at its Alexandria hub by transferring operations to Borg El Arab Airport. EgyptAir also has a secondary hub that is located at Hurghada International Airport, Luxor International Airport, and Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport. 

The period of 2009 – 2010 became one of the most important ones for EgyptAir, as the airline announced its new joint venture with Aviation Capital Group (ACG) and the Egyptian private and public shareholders. The joint venture, called Civil Aviation Finance and Operation Leases (CIAF-Leasing), focused its operation on serving flights to the Middle East and Northern Africa, operating narrow body aircraft. 

After more than 84 years of operation, today EgyptAir operates more than 75 aircraft to 79 destinations worldwide. The airline uses at least nine types of aircraft in its operation. They are Airbus A320-232, Airbus A321-231, Airbus A330-243, Airbus A330-300, Airbus A340-212, Boeing B737-500, Boeing B737-800, Boeing B777-200, and Boeing B777-300. EgyptAir also owns several subsidiaries, which are Air Cairo, Air Sinai, EgyptAir Cargo, EgyptAir Express and Smart Aviation Company.
