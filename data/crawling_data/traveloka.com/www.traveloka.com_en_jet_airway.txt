Jet Airways History


The rapid growth of the Indian financial sector in the early 1990s demanded for a variety of supports, including a more proper aviation infrastructure. Hence, when the Indian government lifted its monopoly of domestic air service in 1991, affluent businessman Naresh Goyal immediately seized the opportunity to found his own airline. In April 1992, Jet Airways was born, becoming one of the oldest private airlines in India. 

At the beginning, Jet Airways leased four Boeing 737-300 from Australia. The aircraft was chosen due to its efficient fuel usage, which was believed to be able to cut operational fee and increase profit. The airline then began its first operation in May 1993 and by 1994 it had to lease another two Boeing aircraft, this time from Malaysia Airlines. At this time, the airline had offered not only an in-flight meal but also an in-flight shopping facility called JetMall. Around the same time, the airline bought 10 new Boeing aircraft. The airline, which until today has always strived to provide on-time flights, satisfying onboard service and overall operational safety, gained a massive profit and a large number of passengers during the 1990s. 

The Indian government then issued a regulation allowing airlines that had been in operation for more than five years to open international routes. Taking advantage of this turn of event, Jet Airways opened routes to Europe, the Arab Peninsula, and Southeast Asia. Brussels then became the airline’s transit terminal for its transatlantic routes, which were the result of India’s increased demand for international flights—an effect of a strong financial condition. The same year, the company rebranded itself by changing its logo.

These achievements were not without obstacles. India’s economic crisis of 2008 affected Jet Airways, creating a big loss. As a solution, the airline conducted a company restructuring, cut certain routes, reduced the number of its flights and replaced several big aircraft. With these strategies, the airline managed to recover from its loss and regain profits, showing that it was capable of handling crisis.

Today, Jet Airways owns more than 100 aircraft to serve 65 domestic and international destinations. With millions of passengers every year and a wide variety of destinations throughout India and the world, Jet Airways is becoming one of the most acknowledged airlines in India. In 2016, Jet Airways dominated 21.1% of India’s air transportation market, making it the second biggest airline in India.
