Oman Air History


Even though Oman Air was founded in 1993, its journey actually had started in 1970. At the time, Oman Air’s forerunner, Oman International Services (OIS), began handling civilian aircraft. Seven years later, OIS took over Gulf Air’s Light Aircraft Division and then the company became Oman Aviation Service (OAS) in 1981. OAS started its regular flights from Muscat to Salalah in 1982 as a joint venture with Gulf Air. In 1993, Oman Air was finally formed, as well as launched its first international flights to Dubai and Trivandrum, India. Flights to other destinations quickly followed, with Kuwait and Karachi services starting in January 1994 and Colombo in October. In 1998, the airline officially joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

By 2007, Government of Oman recapitalized Oman Air, increasing its shareholding from 33% to 80%. It was also announced that Oman Air would reevaluate its strategic plans, with a possibility of entering the long haul market. In order to support this plan, the Government of Oman decided to sell its share of Gulf Air and would instead concentrate on developing Oman Air. Finally, on November 2007, Oman Air introduced its long-haul service by launching flights to Bangkok and London. During the same year, it was also announced that Oman Air had placed an order with Airbus for five Airbus A330 aircraft for delivery in 2009.

The airline did take delivery of its first Airbus A220 that year. In fact, there were quite many memorable things happened in 2009. In addition to that Airbus delivery, Oman Air announced intentions to lease another two units of A330-200s from Jet Airways. The airline also moved its UK-bound service from London Gatwick to London Heathrow, as well as launched new services to Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Male, and Colombo. A year later, Oman Air became the first airline in the world to offer in-flight mobile phone and Wi-Fi internet services on selected routes. By November 2010, the government of Oman held a 99.8-percent stake in the airline. There were also many new routes launched in that year, including Al Ain, Ras Al Khaima, Kuala Lumpur, Lahore, Islamabad, Dammam, Kathmandu, and Milan.

In 2013, the CEO was quoted as saying that Oman Air was studying to move to a 50 aircraft strong fleet by 2017. It was also in that year when Oman Air signed an eight-year contract with Bombardier Aerospace for repair work on Rolls-Royce Trent 700 inlet cowls for the Airbus A330 fleet. A year later, the airline received the first of 24 new aircraft it had on order. Throughout 2015, Oman Air was quite busy with new routes launching to Goa, Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, and non-stop service to Kuala Lumpur. The airline also announced that it would phase out its smaller aircraft to focus on an all Airbus and Boeing fleet.

By the end of 2015, the two units of ATR 42-500 aircraft were withdrawn, while the four Embraer 175 and the Boeing 737-700 aircraft had been retired by the end of 2016. The year of 2016 was quite eventful for Oman Air. The airline launched codeshare with THAI. Some flight services were also improved, from launching second daily service to London Heathrow, introducing flights to Najaf, Iraq, and launching non-stop flights to Guangzhou. Looking back to all those years, it can be concluded that Oman Air has always been maintaining a very high standard of professionalism. No wonder that Oman Air has successfully earned a great reputation in the region.
