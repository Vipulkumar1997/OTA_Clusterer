About EVA Air


EVA Air (IATA code: BR)
is a Taiwanese international airline based at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. Established on 8 March 1989, the airline is a subsidiary of Evergreen Group and has operated flights for passengers and cargo service to more than 77 destinations across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Throughout its journey, EVA Air has received many awards due to its stellar service—from World’s Top 20 Safest Airline from
Airlinerating.com
, Five Star Airline Rating from Skytrax, World’s Best International Airlines from Travel+Leisure, to Best Business Class Comfort Amenities from Skytrax World Airline Awards.

In operating its flight service, EVA Air offers five main cabin classes, which are Economy Class, Elite Class, Business Class, Premium Laurel Class, and Royal Laurel Class. Each class comes with its own convenience and benefits, especially in terms of its baggage allowance. Economy Class passengers flying to/from the United States, Canada, and certain countries in South and Central America are entitled to 30 kg of baggage allowance. Elite Class passengers flying to/from these destinations are entitled to 35 kg of baggage allowance, or 40 kg for Business Class, Premium Laurel Class, and Royal Laurel Class passengers. Meanwhile, Economy Class passengers flying to/from destinations other than the ones mentioned above can carry two pieces of checked baggage weighing no more than 23 kg each, 28 kg each for Elite Class passengers, or 32 kg each for Business Class, Premium Laurel Class, and Royal Laurel Class passengers.

All EVA Air passengers are required to check-in at least one hour before their flight schedule. However, passengers flying to the United States are required to check-in at least three hours before their departure time since due to the strict regulations and tight airport schedules. Moreover, passengers identified as either an unaccompanied child, with disabilities, deaf, blind, use a wheelchair or other assistive devices are recommended to check-in at least two hours before their scheduled departure time.


EVA Air History


EVA Air’s history cannot be separated from the history of Evergreen Marine Corporation, a Taiwanese container transportation and shipping company. On September 1988, during the 20th-anniversary celebration of Evergreen Marine Corporation, the company chairman, Chang Yung-fa, announced his company’s intentions to establish Taiwan’s first private international airline. The new opportunity in the Taiwanese aviation industry opened following a decision from the Taiwanese government to liberalize the country’s air transportation system. Therefore on 8 March 1989, after receiving the regulatory approval, Evergreen Airways was formally established as a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group, with Taiwan Taoyuan Airport as its base of operation. However, since the name was felt too similar with the unrelated Evergreen International cargo airline, the airline later changed its name to EVA Air. 

On October 1989, EVA Airways Corporation placed a US$3.6 billion order for 26 aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, including Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners. Meanwhile, its first flight took place on 1 July 1991, with a small fleet of Boeing 767-300ER aircraft that featured Economy and Business Class seating. These initial services includes flights from Taipei to Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. Later that year, EVA Air expanded its routes to serve cities in East Asia and Vienna, which became EVA Air’s first European destination. Throughout the first year, EVA Air’s revenues reached US$40 million.

In 1992, EVA Air received its first Boeing 747-400 aircraft and launched the 747 transpacific flights to Los Angeles in December that same year. EVA Air also introduced several new cabin classes, which are Premium Economy Class, Economy Deluxe, and Business Class. EVA Air’s Premium Economy cabin was one of the first in the airline industry. It featured a wider 2-4-2 seat configuration, leg rests, individual seatback video, and enhanced meal services. 

One year later, EVA Air decided to expand its route to London, Paris, Seattle, New York, San Francisco, and Sydney. By 1994, EVA Air has provided regular service to 22 destinations worldwide, including to Hawaii, Bali, Fukuoka, and Auckland. The airline also added new aircraft to its fleet, which are three units of MD-11s, one unit of Boeing 747-400, and four units of 767-200s. This fleet addition allowed EVA Air to carry over three million passengers annually.

In 1995, it was announced that EVA Air’s revenues had reached US$1.05 billion. Internationally, EVA Air’s rapid expansion and increased passenger volume were boosted by its safety record. This fact is further strengthened by EVA Air’s achievement in receiving the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification. Later that year, EVA Air Cargo began its first weekly operation using McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. 

In the mid-1990s, EVA Air expanded its business into the domestic Taiwan market by acquiring shares in Makung International Airlines, followed by Great China Airlines and Taiwan Airways. On 1 July 1998, all three carriers merged under the name “UNI Air”. UNI Air became EVA Air’s domestic intra-Taiwanese subsidiary, operating short-haul flights out of its base in the second largest city in Taiwan, Kaohsiung. 

In 2000, EVA Air did its first long-haul fleet renewal. Ordering four aircraft plus eight options of Boeing 777-300ER, EVA Air became one of the first airlines to use this type of aircraft. At the same time, EVA Air also placed three orders for the Boeing 777-200LR. One year later, precisely in January 2001, the airline ordered its first Airbus aircraft, the A330-200. The Boeing 777s were intended for the United States and European services, while the Airbus aircraft were intended for regional Asian routes. Later in March 2001, EVA Air committed to adding more new, technologically advanced aircraft to its fleet. The airline signed a purchase contract for eight Airbus A330-200s, which would be delivered beginning in 2003.

EVA Air continued to innovate their services by launching its online booking system on 9 January 2002. Moreover, it also gained approval to add 24 passenger flights on its Hong Kong routes and to begin a new freighter service. The airline also introduced a new slogan “Just relax, your home in the air”. 

Between 2007 and 2008, EVA Air coped with a surge in fuel prices, which contributed to a US$61.2 million loss. In response, the airline decided to cut its flight schedule and number of employees. However, EVA Air made a comeback in 2009 when it was announced that the airline’s profitability in the first quarter had reached a gain of US$5.9 million. In 2010, EVA Air expanded its service to Toronto, Taipei Songshan, and Tokyo Haneda. The airline also began nonstop flights from Taipei to Guam and from New York (JFK) to Taipei.

By 2014, EVA Air expanded its North American network by adding new routes to Houston and Chicago. With that addition, today EVA Air provides flight service to 77 destinations across the world with its 72 aircraft. These aircraft include three units of B747-400 with 372 seats capacity, 30 units of B777-300ER with 313, 323, 333, and 353 seats capacity, six units of A330-300 with 309 seats capacity, six units of A330-200 with 252 seats capacity, 24 units of A321-200 with 184 seats capacity, and seven units of B747-400F for cargo service.
