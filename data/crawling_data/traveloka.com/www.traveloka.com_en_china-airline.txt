China Airlines Seat Class


Economy Class


As one of the best airlines in the world according to Skytrax, China Airlines provides an artistic in-flight experience on its Economy Class, available on flights to Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Frankfurt, and selected regional routes. The Economy Class cabin is equipped with slimline seats, providing passengers with comfortable legroom and a wide selection of entertainment options. These imprinted seats also symbolize China Airlines’ promise to deliver the best service to its passengers.




In-flight Meal

Passengers departing from Taipei will get an in-flight meal facility served by China Pacific Catering Service (CPCS), who is based in Taipei. The in-flight meal service is also available on all intercontinental flights. However, the menus vary depending on flight class, destination, and the duration. The Eastern and Western meals are the most favorite menus to order, as well as the seasonal menus on selected flight routes.





Premium Economy Class


In addition to the standard Economy Class, China Airlines also offers a Premium Economy Class that comes with more exclusive facilities. Each seat is equipped with a 12-inch HD monitor, a more spacious 39-inch legroom, a multi-function dining table, a personal storage space, a dedicated personal USB port, and a power outlet. Passengers traveling on a long haul flight will also get amenity kits to keep them feeling refreshed throughout the flight.




In-flight Meal

The in-flight meals offered in Premium Economy Class are similar with the ones in Economy Class. Passengers can also pre-order a special meal, including vegetarian meal, religious meal, and infant/child meal. Passengers needing a special meal on their flight can inform the airline during booking, or by contacting China Airlines’ local office at least 24 hours before departure, to request their preferred meal.




Business Class


The Business Class service is available on all China Airlines’ fleets. Whether traveling on a short-haul or a long-haul flight, each passenger is entitled to a premium and exclusive service. There is also a Premium Business Class cabin with a 1-2-1 seat configuration, enabling passengers to have a direct access to the aisle. Each seat in the Business Class cabin is 78-inch wide and can be reclined up to a fully flat 180-degree position.




In-flight Meal

Before the plane takes off, all Business Class passengers will be served in-flight refreshments such as nuts, snacks, and a cup or coffee or tea.

China Airlines In-flight Crew





China Airlines Flight Attendant Uniform

When China Airlines underwent a Next Generation Era (NexGen) program in 2015, the airline implemented a rebranding strategy, which includes changes in its flight attendant’s uniform. To design this new look, China Airlines teamed up with an Oscar-nominee costume designer, William Chang. The new female flight attendant’s uniform features bold color blocks in sharp contrast, such as red and violet, as well as white and blue-gray, creating a taller silhouette to the flight attendants. Meanwhile, the male flight attendants wear uniforms with darker colors. It features a shirt, vest, and formal suit with a sapphire blue accent on the bottom part. There are also special uniforms for the winter season, which includes a coat and shawl.

With more than 12,000 employees, China Airlines operates more than 1.400 flights every week. Aside from being a member of the SkyTeam alliance, China Airlines also has two subsidiaries, which are Mandarin Airlines and Tigerair Taiwan.

Established on 16 December 1959, China Airlines Group emerged from the idea of a retired air force officer. Started its operation as a charter flight service, China Airlines finally established its first scheduled route in 1962, flying from Taipei to Hualien. This route also became the airline’s first domestic service. After almost half a century providing service in the aviation industry, today China Airlines offers flights to 145 destinations across 29 countries worldwide, including 10 European cities, 81 Asian cities, 42 American cities, and 7 Oceania routes. Meanwhile, the domestic routes cover five destinations within Taiwan. China Airlines also owns a cargo service, offering services in similar routes to its international flights.

In operating its flight service, China Airlines offers three flight classes, which are Economy Class, Premium Economy Class, and Business Class.

China Airlines History


China Airlines was found by a retired air force officer and started its journey on 16 December 1959. At the time, China Airlines only had a C54 aircraft and two PBY Amphibians that were used to operate charter flights. In the 1960s, China Airlines finally introduced its first scheduled flight from Taipei to Hualien. This route also became the first domestic flight of China Airlines. One year later, China Airlines added Caravelle and Boeing 727-100 aircraft to its fleet, as well as introduced its first international routes to Southern Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan. On 2 February 1970, the airline purchased a Boeing 707 aircraft, allowing them to expand their flight routes to San Francisco via Tokyo. The route expansion also includes flight services to Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America via Japan and Hawaii.

In 1995, China Airlines unveiled its “plum blossom” logo to replace the national flag, which had previously appeared on the tail fins of its aircraft. The plum blossom was chosen due to its status as Taiwan’s National Flower. 

Throughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. However, due to the company’s poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines changed its pilot recruitment practices and began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records. In addition, the company also began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. Moreover, China Airlines also modified its maintenance and operational procedures, which became instrumental in the company’s improved safety record.

China Airlines joined the SkyTeam global alliance on 14 September 2010 and officially became a full member on 28 September 2011. China Airlines was the first Taiwanese airline to join an airline alliance.

In March 2014, it was announced that China Airlines would be launching a NexGen (NextGeneration) plan to complement the delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER. The program, aimed to refresh the carrier’s brand image, included fleet replacements, product innovations, and new uniform introductions. China Airline wanted to introduce unique product offerings that can showcase the beauty of the East and the cultural creativity of Taiwan.

Over the period between 2011 and 2015, China Airlines focuses on strengthening its regional network. While from 2015 to 2020, the airline focuses on expanding its European, North American, and Oceanian network with its new long haul fleet. On 1 December 2017, China Airlines will begin to operate three flights each week to London Gatwick Airport. Besides London, China Airlines is also considering to open new flight routes to European destinations such as Barcelona, Madrid, Milan, and Paris, as well as to North America that will include Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Toronto.
