About Malindo Air


Malindo Air (IATA code: OD)
is a hybrid airline. Malindo, whose name is an acronym of Malaysia – Indonesia, incorporates premium service, but in affordable fares equivalent to those offered on low-cost carriers (LCC). Malindo Air was established from the cooperation between the Malaysian National Aerospace and Defense Industries (NADI) with Lion Air Indonesia. Until today, Malindo Air has flown to more than 100 cities in Southeast Asia and Australia.

Since 2013, Malindo Air has obtained several awards, which further establishes its position as one of the promising airlines in the world. Malindo Air has successfully obtained the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), which will be valid until 3 June 2018. Some of the airline’s well-earned accolades include Airline of the Year at KLIA Awards 2014, 2015 Top-Performing Airlines by Travelport, and Best Regional Airlines for Asia-Pacific at the Asia Pacific Aviation CAPA Awards on 15 November 2016. Malindo Air was also awarded the CAPA Aviation Awards for Excellence, which is given to airlines that have shown great leadership in adjusting to changes in the industry.

In its operations, Malindo Air uses two types of aircraft, which are Boeing 737-900ER that can carry up to 215 passengers and ATR 72-600 propeller planes that can carry up to 74 passengers. This enables Malindo Air to offer two types of flight classes in its service: economy and business. In Malindo Air’s Economy Class, passengers can enjoy leather seats with a seat pitch of 81 cm, a space large enough for passengers to straighten their legs. This feature is rarely found in the economy class of other airlines. Despite sitting in economy class, passengers can feel the comfort of premium class.

In Malindo Air’s Business Class, passengers can enjoy leather seats with a spacious leg room. The distance between each seat is 114 cm, so other passengers in front of and behind the passenger in the seat will not be disturbed when the seat is reclined. Business Class passengers can also enjoy a wide variety of in-flight entertainment, including movies and music. There is also an 11-inch tablet computer with a USB port, WiFi connection, and a power outlet. The passengers not only can check their emails without worrying about the tablet's battery running out, they can also recharge their electronic devices during the flight.

Like in most airlines, Malindo Air offers different baggage allowances for different flight classes.  Business Class passengers flying on international flights are entitled to 40 kg of checked baggage, while Economy Class passengers are entitled to half of the capacity given to Business Class passengers, which is 20 kg. Especially for flights to Hang Nadim Airport (BTH), Kualanamu (KNO), and Sultan Syarif Kasim II (PKU), Business Class passengers are allowed no more than 20 kg of checked baggage. Business Class passengers traveling on domestic flights are entitled a checked baggage of 40 kg, while Economy Class passengers are entitled to 15 kg. Malindo Air also allows passengers to bring items into the cabin as cabin baggage. These items must not weigh more than 7 kg, with a maximum dimension of 56 cm x 36 cm x 23 cm.

Moreover, traveling with Malindo Air also has its additional benefits. Malindo Air cooperates with its partners to create promotional programs to provide its passengers with added convenience while traveling. Some of these benefits include discounts on hotel stays, discounts on restaurants, discounts to several tourist attractions, as well as discounts for shopping and body treatments in certain salons, which can be very useful for passengers purchasing packages from Malindo Holidays. Passengers can also benefit from the airline’s shuttle service to reach their destination from and to the airport.

Malindo Miles members, especially those with a Platinum and Gold membership, are also granted free access to the Plaza Premium Lounge. The Plaza Premium Lounge is available in several international airports, such as: KLIA1 and KLIA2, Kota Kinabalu International Airport, Kuching International Airport, Penang International Airport, Langkawi International Airport and Changi International Airport in Singapore.

Consistent with its slogan, "Smarter Way To Travel", Malindo Air also offers a travel insurance called Malindo Air Travel Insurance. In cooperation with Chubb Insurance Malaysia Berhad, Malindo Air Travel Insurance can protect its passengers when undesirable things occur during traveling, such as loss of travel documents, loss of baggage, delayed baggage, delayed flights, restricted flights, flight cancellations, and accidents.

To board the plane, passengers are required to check in directly on the Malindo Air check-in counters at the airport, which are available from four hours before the flight. This is to facilitate and ensure passengers will have enough time to check their baggage and go through the security checkpoint, before boarding the flight. Alternatively, passengers can also use the web check-in feature, which is available from 48 hours (two days) until four hours before the flight. This applies to all Malindo Air flight classes.


Malindo Air History


The entrance of Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia to Indonesia, where Indonesian low-cost carrier Lion Air dominates, inspired Indonesian airlines to enter the Malaysian market. On 11 September 2012, Malaysian Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, announced a collaboration between the National Aerospace and Defense Industries (NADI) with Lion Air Indonesia. This collaboration resulted in Malindo Air, whose name is an acronym of the two neighboring Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia and Indonesia.

With Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as the basis of its operation, Malindo Air carried out its first official flight on 22 March 2013, from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. This coincided with the inauguration of Chandran Ramamurthy as CEO Malindo Air, who previously served as Assistant to the President Director of Lion Air Indonesia. At that time, Malindo Air used a fleet of 12 Boeing 737-900ER.

Malindo Air then expand its fleets to include 11 aircraft of ATR 72-600, six aircraft of Boeing 737-900ER, and two aircraft of 737-800. The number kept multiplying until January 2015. This included an order of four additional ATR 72-600 and 18 Boeing 737-900ERs. Along with the growing size of its fleets, Malindo Air also expanded its routes to include Penang, Johor Baru, and Kotabaru in early June 2013. 

On June 2016, it was announced that Malindo and Turkish Airlines had signed an interline agreement to enter new markets. This strategy was expected to help facilitate passengers when traveling between ASEAN and Europe. Qatar Airways also agreed to become partners in the collective agreement. Up until today, Malindo Air has flown to more than 100 cities in Southeast Asia and Australia, which include Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane. The airline also serves flights to Jeddah (to serve Muslim passengers who would like to perform hajj and umrah) and Guangzhou. 

Plans had been made to rebrand Malindo Air into Batik Malaysia. The rebranded airline would focus on serving international flights, while Batik Air, Lion Air’s Indonesian subsidiary, would focus on serving domestic flights in Indonesia. Nevertheless, the rebranding exercise seems to have been put on hold, as the newly delivered B737-800 aircraft, which previously donned the Batik Air Malaysia logo, now bears Malindo Air’s logo instead.
