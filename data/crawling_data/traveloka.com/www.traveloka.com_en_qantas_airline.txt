About Qantas


Qantas (IATA code: QF)
is one of the oldest airlines in the world. Carrying the slogan of “The Spirit of Australia”, Qantas has connected Australia through its domestic routes and brought significant contributions to Australian tourism.  Qantas currently serves flights to more than 150 destinations all over the world, with its main hubs located at the Kingsford Smith Sydney International Airport and Melbourne Airport. However, Qantas also serves flights from and to other airports such as Brisbane Airport, Perth Airport, Changi Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and Heathrow Airport. 

Qantas offers flights in four different classes, from Economy Class, Premium Economy Class, Business Class, to First Class. In each class, Qantas collaborates with notable names in the industry to provide the best service for its passengers. These names include Rockpool, to design Qantas’ in-flight menus, and Kate Spade for its amenity kit. 

Economy and Premium Economy Class passengers are entitled to 23 kg of baggage allowance, while Business Class and First Class passengers are entitled to 32 kg of baggage allowance. Moreover, each passenger can carry two items of cabin baggage which can be stored in the overhead cabin or under their seats.

Check-in must be done at least 45 minutes before domestic flight departures and 60 minutes before international flight departures. However, passengers flying on an international flight are recommended to check in two hours before departure, to ensure enough time to go through immigration and security check. As an alternative, passengers can also use Qantas’ mobile application to check-in online, which is available up to 24 hours before departure.

Qantas also offers executive lounge facilities in certain airports, where passengers can relax while waiting for their departure time and enjoy a wide range of facilities they offer.

Due to its exquisite service, Qantas has received several notable awards, such as best wine and champagne in the cabin, best entertainment system, and excellent service. Furthermore, Qantas always serves award-winning wine on its First Class and Business Class and therefore awarded as the airlines with the widest range of wine choice and airline with most authentic wine on the cabin.

Qantas History


Qantas was formed by Paul McGuinness, Fergus McMaster, Hudson Fysh, and Arthur Baird, under the name Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services on 16 November 1920. At that time, the first aircraft Qantas owned was an Avro 540K, which only has three seats—one pilot seat and two passenger seats. One of the passengers in Qantas’ first flight is an 84-year-old man, Alexander Kennedy, who is recognized as the owner of the first ticket Qantas had ever sold in history. 

Qantas’ logo and livery have been changed six times since its establishment in 1920. The original Qantas logo features a round shape with a kangaroo named Retro Roo, inspired by the Australian penny at that time. Despite the many changes, the kangaroo has always been featured on each of Qantas logo and livery due to its strong identification to Australia. The latest version of the logo, the one used today, features a more modern design with bright contemporary colors.

During its first years, Qantas provided services to carry airmail under the subsidiary of the Australian government. In 1928, Qantas rented its aircraft to be used by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, a program which sent health workers and medical equipment to remote areas of the country. Between 1926 and 1928, Qantas added eight operating aircraft, parked in their hangar in Longreach, which included seven units of De Havilland DH 50 and one unit of DH 9. Throughout these years, Qantas only served domestic flights within Australia. 

However, in 1934, Qantas made a deal with Britain’s Imperial Airways—later known as British Airways—to form Qantas Empire Airways Limited (QEA) to serve long-haul flights in Australia. The new airline commenced operations in December 1934, flying between Brisbane and Darwin. QEA flew internationally from May 1935, when the service from Darwin was extended to Singapore, with Imperial Airways operating the rest of the service through to London. After World War II began, enemy action and accidents destroyed half of the Qantas’ fleet, when most of the fleet was taken over by the Australian government for war service.

After the war had finished, QEA was nationalized by the Australian Government under the Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley. Yet, this decision did not benefit QEA. Its domestic flights were shifted and handled by Australia’s national airline, Trans Australian Airlines, while QEA was only allowed to serve international flights. However, not long after, QEA did its first flight outside the Commonwealth countries, to Tokyo and Hong Kong. Qantas then entered the jet age when its first Boeing 707-138 was delivered in June 1959, making Qantas as one of the airlines with the most up-to-date aircraft models. 

On 14 September 1992, Qantas merged with a nationally-owned domestic airline, Australian Airlines—previously known as Trans Australia Airlines. In the following year, the airline started to be rebranded as Qantas, which was gradually privatized between 1993 and 1997, resulting in at least 51% of Qantas to be owned by Australian shareholders.

In 1998, Qantas founded
one
world® alliance together with American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, and Cathay Pacific. The alliance commenced operation in February 1999, with Iberia Airlines and Finnair joining later that year.
One
world® markets itself at the premium travel market, offering passengers a larger network than each airline could on its own. The airlines also work together to provide operational synergies to keep costs down.

Until 2001, Qantas owned almost 90% of the market share in Australia. However, with the entry of a new budget airline, Virgin Blue, into the domestic market, Qantas’ market share fell. Therefore, Qantas created Jetstar Airways in 2001, a low-cost carrier to compete in the market. Although Qantas could not achieve its 90% market share back, with the creation of Jetstar Airways, Qantas Group’s market share remained stable at about 65%, with 30% for Virgin Blue and other regional airlines accounting for the rest of the market. 

Qantas had proven its endurance in the airline business for almost 100 years. Started off carrying only one to two passengers in each flight, Qantas now flies 450 passengers to travel around the world with one of its Airbus A380 aircraft. Qantas has now grown into an airline with 220 aircraft in its fleet, consisting of Airbus and Boeing. Throughout the years, Qantas has always improved their technology and service to give their passengers an unsurpassed journey in flying.
