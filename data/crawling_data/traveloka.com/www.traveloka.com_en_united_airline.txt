United Airlines History


Claimed as the oldest airline in the United States, United Airlines began its history with the name Varney Air Lines, founded by Walter Varney. Leon D. "Lee" Cuddeback, the main pilot in Varney Air Lines, led the air postal service airline with a Swallow biplane from Varney Airlines’ headquarter in Boise, Idaho, to a postal hub located in Pasco, Washington. Cuddeback flew Varney Air Lines’ first flight on 6 April 1926 and returned the next day with 200 pounds of mail. This date then became the day when United Airlines was found.

In 1927, aviation pioneer William Boeing founded his airline Boeing Air Transport to operate the San Francisco to Chicago air mail route. In 1929, Boeing formed the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC), which then set to buy several other airlines, including Varney Air Lines. On 28 March 1931, UATC formed United Air Lines, Inc. as a holding company for its airline subsidiaries.

In 1933, the United commenced its operation with the Boeing 247 airliner, which was able to fly a transcontinental flight in 20 hours, making it 50 percent faster than its predecessors. After the passage of the Air Mail Act in 1934, UATC was broken up and all of its airline subsidiaries were merged into United Air Lines.

Then in 1961, United merged with Capital Airlines and established its position as the United States’ largest airline. United became the first carrier to operate the Boeing 767 in 1982, and the first airline to introduce the Boeing 777 in its commercial service in 1995. In 1997, United co-founded the Star Alliance along with several other airlines.

On 16 April 2010, United resumed merger talks with Continental Airlines, which was initially started in 2008. The airlines finally reached an agreement to combine operations on 2 May 2010. The merged airline would adopt Continental's logo and livery, with Continental's CEO Jeff Smisek serving as the head of the new company. Both airlines planned to begin merging operations in 2011 to form the world's biggest carrier and began operating under a single operating certificate from the FAA on 30 November 2011. On 3 March 2012, United and Continental merged their passenger service systems, frequent-flier programs, and websites, virtually eliminating the Continental brand in the eye of the consumer.

After the merger of United and Continental, the airlines changed its slogan into "Let's fly together" in October 2010. However, on 20 September 2013, United announced the return of its slogan, “Fly the Friendly Skies”, which was initially introduced in 1965. 

Furthermore, United also changed its logo following the merger. In 1973, United Airlines commissioned Saul Bass, a designer, to develop a new logo and livery for United Airlines. The new logo and livery, the "Tulip", featured blue, red, and white colors and tulip patterns formed from the "U" letter. Although the logo underwent several changes over the years, it always depicted a tulip element. However, after the merger with Continental Airlines, the “Tulip” was replaced by Continental Airlines "globe" made by Lippincott Company.

Today, United Airlines has grown into the world's third-largest airline when measured by revenue, with an extensive presence in the Asia-Pacific region. United operates out of nine hubs located in Chicago, Denver, Guam, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. Through these hubs, the airline serves flights to 235 domestic destinations in the United States and 136 international destinations in 60 countries across Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania.
