American Airlines History


American Airlines was formed in 1930 by 80 small-scale airlines. In the beginning of its formation, American Airlines was named American Airways. Three years after it was formed, the airline had served flights to 52 cities, most of which are in the United States. The name of American Airlines was first adopted in 1934 when this airline was acquired by E. L. Cord. A businessman from Texas, C. R. Smith, was appointed as the leader of the company. C. R. Smith then cooperated with Donald Douglas to make a new aircraft, named DC-3. Later, DC-3 woud be referred to as Flagship. American Airlines was the first airline to operate a DC-3 for commercial service. This aircraft flew from New York to Chicago.

In 1936, American Airlines launched Admirals Club as one of its lounge facilities for passengers. In the beginning, this facility was only available for passengers who received an invitation, but over time, anyone was able to register for membership by paying some fees. Built in LaGuardia Airport, Admirals Club is the first lounge in the world. Today, American Airlines has 50 Admirals Club around the world. 

To expand the company, the airline built a new base in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1946. This base was used as a place to maintain aircraft owned by the company. In 1953, American Airlines launched non-stop transcontinental flight service all around the United States. This service, which used Douglas DC-7 aircraft, was the first non-stop transcontinental flight in the world.

In 1957 American Airlines built a flight attendant college in Dallas and named it American Airlines Stewardess College. The main focus of the college was to train its students to become the best professional flight attendants in the air. Two years after, American Airlines introduced its Boeing 707. Due to an increase of demand, the airline built another terminal in John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. This terminal became the base of the airline before it moved to Fort Worth, Texas in 1979. In 1981, American Airlines launched the frequent flyer program AAdvantage. The following year, this airline also opened a route from Dallas to London followed by some routes to Asia and Europe.

By 1991, American Airlines had celebrated its achievement of serving one billion passengers. In 2010, American Airlines developed a partnership with a number of airlines, including British Airways, Iberia, and Jetblue. In the same year, 27 new destinations were added. A year later, In 2011, AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines suffered bankruptcy, which prompted its merger with US Airways two years later in 2013. American Airlines and US Airways began their operation as one brand in 2015 with the Single Passenger Service. Since their merger, American Airlines and US Airways have operated under the American Airlines brand.
