What is Pocket WiFi rental?



Pocket WiFi router is a mobile device that connects you to the Internet by providing a WiFi hotspot, which can be shared with other devices (e.g. smartphone, iPad, laptop, etc.) at the same time. By renting a WiFi router through Traveloka, you will stay connected anywhere in the world!



In which countries can I use the WiFi router?



Currently, WiFi router is only available for use within Singapore.



What should I do to rent a WiFi router through Traveloka?



First, you need to purchase a WiFi router voucher. One voucher is only valid for one-day rental (which means you will need three vouchers for three days of rental, four vouchers for four days of rental, and so on.). Upon successful payment verification,, we will send you a confirmation email along with the voucher. You may also find your voucher under the
My Booking
menu on Traveloka App.

To redeem your voucher, go to any of our partner’s voucher redemption counter at Changi Airport Singapore Terminal 1, 2 or 3. Simply show your voucher from your mobile screen, without having to print it out!



Where should I go to collect and return the rented WiFi router?



You will need to pick up the WiFi router at Changi Airport Singapore at one of the following locations:


Arrival Hall Public Area Terminal 1 Booth T1A (next to Starbucks)

Arrival Hall Public Area Terminal 2 Booth T2 (across belt 34)

Arrival Hall Public Area Terminal 3 booth Booth T3 (across belt 42)


Location details for device collection will be given in the confirmation email. To return the device, simply go to any of the pickup locations.



Do I need a credit card for router rental deposit?



An S$200 credit card authorization hold deposit is required at pickup. No cash accepted. The temporary hold will be placed at the time of rental and released when you return the device. There will be no actual charges made on your credit card -- the authorization hold will be removed from your account (and thus returning your balance) by the time the device is returned. Expect the balance to appear in 14 to 30 working days from the date of rental, depending on the issuing bank of your credit card.

All additional fees incurred -- such as rental extension, late fees and charges for damaged/lost/stolen devices -- will be collected at return.



How are WiFi router rental days calculated?



WiFi router rental period will begin at 24:00 SGT each day. So if you redeem the WiFi router voucher for two days on 1 January 2017 at 10:00 SGT, then the device should be returned before 24:00 SGT on 2 January 2017. The total rental days will be calculated upon device return.



How do I extend the WiFi router rental period?



You need to purchase additional vouchers through Traveloka. Please note that one voucher is only valid for one day, which means you would need three vouchers for three additional days of rental, four vouchers for four additional days, etc.

When you return the WiFi router, simply bring the additional voucher(s) and show it to the counter staff. If your voucher is insufficient, you will be charged an additional fee which is deducted from the deposit that you have paid in advance.



What should I do if I forget to return the WiFi router?



If you do not return the device, then the S$200 deposit will not be returned to your credit card balance. Please make sure that you have enough time before your scheduled departure to return the WiFi router at the respective counter.



After I entered my BOLT! number, I saw that the Indonesia calling code +62 was added in front of the number. Is this OK?



Yes. The calling code +62 is automatically added by our system to your BOLT! number. If you see +62999xx on your search results, order details and anywhere else, rest assured we acknowledged that you have entered the correct BOLT! destination number.



What are the available payment options?



Traveloka accepts payments via bank transfer (ATM/SMS Banking/e-banking/bank teller), ATM (all ATMs with ATM Bersama, Prima or Alto logo), Credit Card (Visa/MasterCard) and Internet Banking (BCA KlikPay, Mandiri ClickPay and CIMB Clicks).

Please visit

If I purchase a data package through Traveloka, would it deduct my credit balance?



No. You are paying for your data package separately and we will not take your existing credit balance.



Can I purchase a data package for my mobile number during its grace period?



No. Before making any purchase, please ensure that your destination number is not within its grace period. Please make sure your number has not been deactivated, or try reactivate your number before purchasing a data package.



Can I top up another person’s number? How do I top up for more than one number?



Of course. You can top up for your friends and family too. However, you can only top up for one prepaid mobile phone or BOLT! number at a time, so please make another transaction if you would like to top up more than one destination number.



Can I top up or purchase data packages of the exact same amount multiple times for one destination phone number?



You can do so for all operators except Tri, BOLT! and Smartfren. Please do not purchase the exact same product (either top-up credit or data package) from one of these operators within 30 minutes, as this may result in failure of top-up completion by the operator.



Why haven’t I received my top-up credit?



There could be several reasons why this happened:


1. You have entered a postpaid destination number

2. The number you entered is inactive or expired

Can I purchase my data roaming package after I arrive at my destination country?



Yes, you can. However, you will need Internet connection to do so. We recommend that you purchase your data roaming package prior to your departure, so you can check your roaming status and contact us for any assistance before you leave.



What should I do to be able to use the data roaming package?



For Telkomsel prepaid users, please ensure that your phone number is correct and active (not blocked/expired/in grace period). If you are a Telkomsel postpaid user, you need to check your roaming feature eligibility by dialing *266#. Select 7 (Info) then 2 (Fitur Roaming) and 2 (Check Status). If roaming feature is disabled, please enable it first at your nearest GraPARI outlet.


To check your activation status, remaining data and other bonus, please dial *266# and follow the instructions. We recommend that you check your activation status before departing to your destination country. If you have any issues while you are abroad, Telkomsel Call Center can be reached at +628110000333.



When does the active period of my Telkomsel data roaming package begin?



If you wish to activate your data roaming package at the time of purchasing, your package will be active immediately and expire 24 hours after the activation time. However, if you wish to activate your data roaming package for one day on, for example, 1 June 2017, the package will be activated between 02:00 – 04:00 UTC/GMT+7 and expire at the same time on 2 June 2017.



Can I change the active period?



Unfortunately, you cannot change the active period of your data roaming package. We suggest that you recheck your transaction details, which contain the activation date of your roaming package along with its active period, before confirming your purchase.



What should I do if I entered the wrong number for the purchased package roaming?



Unfortunately, if your roaming package is already successfully scheduled or activated, we will not be able to change the destination number or issue a refund for your transaction.

What is an electricity token?



Electricity token is a 20-digit number that you must enter into your electricity meter to get electricity. Electricity tokens are provided by Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).



I could not find the option to purchase my electricity token via Traveloka. What should I do?



Please make sure that you have logged in to your Traveloka account. Once you are logged in, you will be able to access the PLN Electricity menu from Traveloka App homepage.



Will I be charged an admin fee?



Yes, each transaction will carry an admin fee, which you will be able to see in the PLN Electricity homepage. You can also find it in the price details after choosing your preferred payment method.



Why can’t I buy tokens after 11 pm?



PLN is scheduled to be offline at 23:00 – 00:59. All transactions during that period will be processed at 01:00.



I have entered my Meter Number, but could not proceed to the next step. Why is that?



There could be several reasons why this happened:
The Meter Number/Customer ID number does not exist
PLN system is offline
Traveloka system is undergoing maintenance
Your internet connection is unstable
To proceed with your transaction, please make sure your Meter Number/Customer ID number is valid and try again soon.



How many kWh will I get if I buy a Rp100.000 token?



The amount of kWh you receive varies depending on your tariff classification (R1, B1, I1, etc.), voltage (900VA, 1300VA, etc.), regional taxes, and subsidies.
You will know the amount of kWh you have purchased only after you have completed your transaction.



My transaction failed due to kWh overlimit. What should I do?



PLN imposes a maximum kWh per electricity meter per month. If you find yourself in this situation, please contact Traveloka Customer Service at 0804-1500-308.



What are the available payment options to purchase electricity tokens?



You can top up your meter and buy tokens easily via bank transfer, credit card (Visa/MasterCard), and other payment methods.



My transaction failed due to kWh overlimit. What should I do?



PLN imposes a maximum kWh per electricity meter per month. If you find yourself in this situation, please contact Traveloka Customer Service at 0804-1500-308.



I have successfully purchased an electricity token. Where can I find the token?



You can find your 20-digit electricity token under the Purchase List and My Booking menus.



Why is the amount of kWh I get this month different from the previous month, despite spending the same amount of money?



kWh calculation is within the authority of PLN. Hence, this could be due to some changes in PLN taxes/subsidies (PPN, PPJ), or changes in your tariff classification. You may contact PLN Call Center at 123 for more information.



I tried punching in the token into my meter, but it did not work. Why is that?



There are two possible reasons why this happened:
You had entered an incorrect number into the meter
A PLN electricity voucher contains a 20-digit token. Please make sure you did not enter the wrong number or mix up two or more digits, and then try again.
You had purchased a token for the wrong meter
Please check your Meter Number (the 11-digit number shown on your electricity meter and Listrik Pintar card) and the numbers you had entered during purchase on the Purchase List. Electricity tokens are issued per Meter Number, and can only be used on that specific meter. If you had entered the wrong Meter Number, your transaction cannot be refunded.



I had entered the wrong Meter Number during purchase. Can I get a refund?



Unfortunately, we will not be able to return your payment or cancel your transaction. To prevent this from happening, be sure to recheck the Meter Number (the 11-digit number shown on your electricity meter and Listrik Pintar card) before making your payment.
