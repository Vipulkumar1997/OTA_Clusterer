China Southern Airlines History


China Southern Airlines was established in 1991 due to the decentralization of CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) by the Chinese Government. This decentralization resulted in the establishment of seven regional airlines, including China Southern Airlines. This airline began its operation in 1991 using Antonov and Boeing aircraft. At this time, the airline operated 160 flights each day, covering 100 routes.

In December 1992, the airline ordered six units of Boeing 777. In 1993, the airline completed its decentralization from CAAC when it gained independence on 10 October 1993. During this early years, China Southern Airlines was the dominant domestic airline in Mainland China. Together with the two major airlines of China–Air China and China Eastern–the airline handled half of passenger traffic carried by all Chinese carriers. 

To raise its operating standards and distance itself from mostly unprofitable second and third tiers domestic airlines, China Southern Airlines worked together with a number of foreign airlines regarding staff training and aircraft maintenance, with the ultimate aim of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In the mid-1990s, China Southern Airlines began to expand its international reach beyond Asia. In December 1995, the Chinese and United States governments signed an agreement that would allow the commencement of non-stop air services between the two countries. In November 2016, the airline began serving flights from Guangzhou to Amsterdam via Amsterdam, its first long-haul route. The following year, China Southern Airlines commenced non-stop trans-Pacific services to Los Angeles and Brisbane.

With the arrival of Boeing 777 in late December 1995, China Southern Airlines began its European and American services. Two years later, in July 1997, the airline was successfully listed on the Hong Kong and New York Stock Exchanges, raising $600–$700 million. Much of the funds were used to facilitate the airline’s fleet expansion. By 1197, the airline, along with Xiamen Airlines, Shantou Airlines, and Guangxi Airlines, was carrying around 15 million passengers per year using around 90 aircraft. It operated 270 routes among 68 destinations and almost 2,450 flights per week. The airline group's revenue totaled at around US$1.4 billion with a net income of $90 million.

By June 2016, almost ten years later, China Southern Airlines has carried more than 900 million passengers. The airline now operates more than 2,000 flights every day, to 208 destinations across 40 countries. With its many awards and achievements, China Southern Airlines has grown into the world’s fourth-largest airline in the world and the largest airline in Asia in terms of passengers carried.
