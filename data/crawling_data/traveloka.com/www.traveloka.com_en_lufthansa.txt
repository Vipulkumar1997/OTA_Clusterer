Lufthansa History


Lufthansa was first established in 1926, under the name Deutsche Luft Hansa A.G. (DLH). The airline was Germany's flag carrier until 1945 when all services were suspended following the defeat of Nazi Germany. In an effort to create a new national airline, a company called Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf (Luftag), was established on 6 January 1953, with many of its staff having worked for the pre-war Lufthansa.

On 1 April 1955, Lufthansa acquired approval to start operating domestic flights, linking Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Cologne, and Munich. Meanwhile, the airline started operating international flights on 15 May 1955, flying to London, Paris, and Madrid, followed by flights to New York City from 1 June of that year, and across the South Atlantic from August 1956. In 1958, Lufthansa ordered four Boeing 707s and started operating flights from Frankfurt to New York City in March 1960. Lufthansa then expanded its routes beyond Bangkok, Thailand, to Hong Kong and Tokyo in 1961. Flights to African countries like Nigeria, Lagos, and Johannesburg in South Africa were later introduced in 1962. Later in 1964, Lufthansa introduced the Boeing 727 and began the Polar route from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Anchorage in May that same year. In February 1965, the airline ordered 21 Boeing 737s that went into service in 1968. 

Lufthansa then began operating wide-body aircraft with its Boeing 747 on 26 April 1970, followed by the introduction of the DC-10-30 on 12 November 1973, and the first Airbus A300 in 1976. In 1979, Lufthansa became one of the two first airlines to operate the Airbus A310 by ordering 25 units of this aircraft. 

The airline began modernizing its fleet on 29 June 1985, by ordering 15 units of Airbus A320s and seven Airbus A300-600s, followed by 10 units of Boeing 737-300s a few days later. Lufthansa also bought Airbus A321, Airbus A340, and Boeing 747-400 aircraft. In addition, Lufthansa also adopted a new corporate identity in 1988. The fleet was given a new livery, while cabins, city offices, and airport lounges were redesigned.

On 18 May 1997, Lufthansa, Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways International, and United Airlines formed Star Alliance, the world's first global airline alliance. This alliance includes cooperation in program integration, information technology development, and flight schedule coordination.

On 6 December 2006, Lufthansa ordered 20 units of Boeing 747-8s, becoming the first airline to operate the aircraft in 2012. The airline was also the second European airline to operate the Airbus A380, after it was delivered on 19 May 2010. In September 2013, Lufthansa Group announced an order for 59 wide-body aircraft valued more than EUR 14 billion, its biggest order yet. Earlier in the same year, the airline group also placed an order for 100 next-generation narrow-body aircraft. Currently, Lufthansa is operating with a fleet of 273 aircraft, with another 158 aircraft waiting to be delivered.
