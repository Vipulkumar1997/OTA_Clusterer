Air France History


Established on 7 October 1933, Air France has become one of the oldest airlines in the world. The airline was formed resulting from the merger of several airlines, which include Air Orient, Air Union, Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne (CIDNA), and Société Générale de Transport Aériens (SGTA). With their routes combined, the airline network extends far to Europe, North Africa, as well as other countries. 

On 26 June 1945, all of France’s air transport companies were nationalized. Not long after, precisely on 29 December 1945, the French Government granted Air France the management of the entire French air transport network. On 1 July 1946, Air France began serving direct flights between Paris and New York. To serve this route, the airline used a Douglas DC-4 aircraft which was able to cover the route in just under 20 hours. By 1948, Air France operated 130 aircraft, making it one of the largest fleets in the world.

From 1974, Air France began shifting the bulk of operations to the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in the north of Paris. In the same year, Air France also became the world's first commercial airline to operate the Airbus A300 twin-engine wide-body aircraft.

By 1983, the airline’s 50th anniversary, Air France has employed more than 34,000 people, with a fleet of 100 aircraft. At that time, Air France served flights to 150 destinations across 73 countries. This made Air France the fourth-largest scheduled passenger airline in the world, as well as the second-largest scheduled freight carrier. In the same year, Air France became the first European airline to serve passenger flights to South Korea.

Together with Lufthansa, Iberia, and SAS Group, Air France then founded Amadeus in 1987. Amadeus is an IT company that would enable travel agencies to sell flight tickets or other airline products from a single system. 

On 12 January 1990, the operations of government-owned Air France, semi-public Air Inter, and wholly private Union de Transports Aériens (UTA) were merged into an enlarged Air France. Air France's acquisition of UTA and Air Inter was part of a government plan to create a unified, national air carrier with a global reach to counter potential threats from the liberalization of the European Union’s internal air transport market.

On 19 February 1999, Air France became partially privatized, with its shares listed on the Paris Stock Exchange on 22 February 1999. In June 1999, Air France and Delta Air Lines formed a bilateral transatlantic partnership. This partnership expanded on 22 June 2000, when the two airlines became the founding members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance.

On 30 September 2003, Air France announced its merger with a Netherlands-based airline, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Despite the merger, Air France and KLM continued to fly under their own brand names. Initially, Air France owned 81% shares of the new company, with 44% owned by the French Government and 37% by private shareholders, while KLM owned the rest. However, in December 2004, the French Government sold 18.4% of its share, effectively privatizing the Air France–KLM Group. Air France–KLM then grew to become the largest airline in the world in terms of revenues, and third-largest, or largest in Europe, in passenger kilometers. 

As of 2016, Air France–KLM Group has employed 84,602 people. With a fleet of 225 aircraft, the airline currently serves flights to 36 domestic destinations in France and 168 international destinations in 93 countries around the world.
