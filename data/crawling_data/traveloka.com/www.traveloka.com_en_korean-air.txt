About Korean Air


Korean Air (IATA Code: KE)
is the main and largest flag carrier in South Korea, and also one of the founding members of SkyTeam, the largest airline alliance in the world. Considered as one of the top 20 airlines in the world, the airline currently serves both domestic and international flights to 131 destinations across 46 countries. Korean Air has two main hubs, which are the Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport, as well as two secondary hubs, which are Gimhae International Airport and Jeju National Airport. 

Across the years, Korean Air has gained several achievements. The airline was named as Asia’s Leading Airline for its First Class service in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. It was also named as World’s Most Innovative Airline in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Korean Air was also awarded the World’s Excellence in Service Award in 2012 for its overall service quality. 

Korean Air offers a frequent flyer program called SKYPASS, which is available for passengers age 12 years old and above.

However, airports in Europe, Middle East, and the United States limit their check-in time to 60 minutes before departure due to security reasons. Boarding time for domestic flights is limited to five minutes before departure, and 10 minutes for international flights. Korean Air strongly urged passengers to arrive earlier at the airport to ensure enough time for check-in and boarding.


Korean Air History


Korean Air, formerly known as Korean Air Lines, was established by the South Korean government in 1946 to replace the declining Korean National Airlines. Hanjin Transport Group, a private company, later acquired the airline on 1 March 1969, changing the airline's status from state-owned to private. The privatization process encouraged the airline's development to become a respectable company, steadily growing into a large-scale carrier service and passenger airline. 

In April 1971, Korean Air started its first international freight service to the United States, with Seoul – Tokyo – Los Angeles route. One year later, Korean Air started its international flight to the same country, with Seoul – Tokyo – Honolulu – Los Angeles route. Korean Air later added Boeing 747 to its fleet and started to operate its European routes, with the first flights flying to Paris in 1973 (cargo) and 1975 (direct passenger flight). Korean Air also started its first passenger service to the United States in March 1979, with its first direct flight from Seoul to New York. 

Korean Air saw the beginning of a full revitalization in the 1980s. First, the airline got a new, dedicated cargo terminal in Los Angeles. The airline also introduced a new system called Total Passenger Service System (TOPAS), which was an integrated reservation and ticketing system. Then, the airline opened its own Flight Crew Training Center in January 1984. The company name was also changed in March 1984, from Korean Air Lines to Korean Air. Finally, a new logo that featured the familiar red-and-blue Taegeuk (Korean Yin-Yang circle) was introduced. The logo was established to represent the company’s continuous growth and innovation.

Korean Air then added new international routes during the 1990s. In April 1990, the airline opened its first Australian route with a Seoul – Sydney flight. In October 1992, the airline flew its first passenger flight to Sao Paulo, Brazil. In December 1994, the company added several routes to China, such as to Tianjin, Qingdao, Beijing, and Shenyang—all of which were direct flights from Seoul. Korean Air also started its first Computer Center in October 1990 and saw the first graduates of pilots from Korean Air Pilot Training Center in May 1992.

Korean Air finally introduced its 100th aircraft in 1995, a Boeing 747-400, showing a promise of future growth in welcoming the 21st century. However, the market for airline service in South Korea had been overly-saturated back then, with many of the competitions offering cheap costs as the main appeal. Therefore, Korean Air started to broaden its venture to another travel establishment by opening Cheju KAL Hotel in May 1996. The airline also added new A330-300 and B777-200 aircrafts to its fleet in 1997.

In 1998, the company achieved a historical milestone when one of its cargo planes finally flew over North Korea, after being banned for years in the years before. Korean Air also started its widespread global alliance in 2000 by partnering with Delta Airlines, Air France, and Aeroméxico through SkyTeam. It also added a new crew training center in Gimpo, to accommodate its growing services. Yang Ho Co, the son of Korean Air founder Choong Hon Co, became the new CEO in 1999 and brought several innovations and business plans to face the upcoming growth and competition.

Korean Air then revitalized its corporate identity in the mid-2000s. In 2004, on the airline’s 35th anniversary, Korean Air adopted a new logo. The new logo features a modification of the Yin-Yang symbol, with red and blue colors, split in the middle with a white propeller. The logo was created to established Korean Air’s status as the flag carrier of South Korea, while also symbolizing the balancing force of company dynamics. In 2005, Korean Air was internationally known as the Number One Cargo Carrier in the world. The airline also started to publish its own in-flight magazine, titled Beyond, in 2006.

In 2007, Korean Air launched a low-cost air carrier service called Jin Air, which was designed to compete with Korea Train Express (KTX), a high-speed railway system. The airline also started its first flight to Japan with Seoul – Narita route in 2011, using the Airbus A380 aircraft. Korean Air also refurbished many aspects of its technology in the 21st century. For example, the company completed its ERP system and opened HJ Navoi Complex in 2012. The airline also added a new aircraft to its fleet, a Boeing 747-8, which was the first of intercontinental aircraft of its kind. It also perfected its Passenger Service System in 2014, and finally opened an engine test facility together with P&W; in 2016. Now, Korean Air is recognized not only as the largest South Korean airline, but also one of the best airlines in the world in terms of service and technology.
