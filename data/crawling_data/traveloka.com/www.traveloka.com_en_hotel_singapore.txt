About
Singapore is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia known to be prosperous, clean and modern. It is located in the north of *
Riau
Islands* and south of
Malaysia
.

Among states in Asia, due to its rapid economic development, Singapore attracts many foreigners to immigrate to work and study. As one of Asia’s top destinations for holiday, Singapore is also a tourist magnet.

The amount of foreigners in Singapore covers almost half of its population. With 70 percent of the Chinese descendents living in Singapore, other ethnics derive from Malaysia, India and Eurasia.

The diverse ethnics in Singapore impacts positively towards its tourism development. In culinary, for instance, you can easily encounter various luxurious as well as budget restaurants offering different food and beverages from all over the world.

Singapore major areas

Singapore is an archipelago divided into 63 beautiful islands: *
Singapore
(the main island)*, Jurong, Sentosa, Ubin and Tekong. Some of the 63 are artificial islands, including Jurong Island.

These are five main areas in Singapore:

Central region

Although this region is known as a business area, the central region covers green areas such as recreational parks. In the central region, you may visit places such as Bukit Merah,
Bukit Timah
and
Marine Parade
.

East region

Changi International Airport is located around this region. The east region is not large, however, it is the most populated among all five Singapore major areas.

Singapore History

Before it was known as a clean, modern and developed country, Singapore was a settlement named by the Javanese term, Temasek, which means ‘the ocean city’. At the time, it was ruled under the Sriwijaya Empire. Temasek was also once ruled by the Sultanate of Johor. However in 1613, Temasek was burnt down by the Portuguese who urged to seize power.

In the 19th century, as it was colonized by the British, the south region of Singapore became a trade area. Some parts of Singapore at the time had also begun to be inhabited by the British.

During World War II, Japan made their way to invade Singapore from the British. This was the era where many Chinese-Singaporeans were slaughtered. However on 12 September 1945, Singapore fell again to the hands of the British government. By 1963, Singapore had already reached its independence.

Cars are rarely used in Singapore, at least not as often as MRT, bus and taxi. Taxi can sometimes be the more effective vehicle in Singapore as it can pick you up anywhere, be booked online or by phone.

Trains: MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) and LRT (Light Rail Transit)

MRT serves routes to all major areas in Singapore. To get in and out of the stations, all tickets are activated through RFID (Radio Frequency Identification, a tracking device).

There are two kinds of smart cards eligible for MRT (and other public transportations in Singapore): EZ-link and NETS FlashPay. These cards can be recharged at all MRT stations.

A single trip ticket costs 0.80 SGD-2.20 SGD.

MRT operates daily from 05:30 to midnight.

Bus

If you are taking the bus, make sure to pay the bus fare with either EZ-link or NETS FlashPay smart cards as they can be cheaper than cash. If you pay with cash, make sure to pay the exact amount (and not more) as the driver does not give change.

How to use EZ-link or Nets FlashPay for bus rides:

When you enter or exit the bus stop, do not forget to tap your card/ticket onto the card reader located near the exit. The nominal in your card will automatically be charged based on your travel distance. In contrary, if you forget to tap your ticket on the card reader, it will charge a higher fare.

Bus operates daily from 05:30 to midnight.

Night bus:

There are two buses operating at night: NightRider and Nite Owl.

City Hall
, China Town and
Raffles Place
.
