About Singapore Airlines


Singapore Airlines Limited (IATA code: SQ)
is based in Singapore Changi International Airport. Carrying the slogan “A Great Way to Fly”, Singapore Airlines has managed to become one of the biggest and best airlines in Asia. Not only that, Singapore Airlines has also been named as the second airline with the largest capitalization in the world by The International Air Transport Association (IATA). With its seven fleets, Singapore Airlines has successfully reached more than 62 destinations in 32 countries across five continents.

The yellow bird on the Singapore Airlines logo was inspired from a traditional dagger called keris. Keris itself is a typical weapon of Southeast Asia, spoken of prominently in folklores. The keris is at the core of Singapore Airlines’ branding, as it is shown on the aircraft's tail fin and in all Singapore Airlines warranties. Singapore Airline has had this logo since it was still a part of the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines system.

Singapore Airlines offers a frequent flyer program, which is divided into four levels: KrisFlyer, KrisFlyer Eliter Silver, KrisFlyer Eliter Gold, and Priority Passenger Service Club. Each level pampers passengers with different comfort and luxury. Additionally, Singapore Airlines offers Boarding Pass Privileges, which provides a variety of attractive deals in selected hotels, shopping malls, and boutiques. Furthermore, Singapore Airlines is also ready to treat its transit passengers with the free 2.5-hour Singapore Tour and the SIA Hop-on Bus, which will take passengers to all of the interesting places Singapore has to offer in one day.

Singapore Airlines provides five types of flight class with different facilities and services. Classes include: Economy Class, Premium Economy Class, Business Class, First Class, and Suites. All classes are complemented with in-flight entertainment featuring the best selections of movies, television programs, music, games, and mobile applications, and in-flight connectivity, such as internet access, in-seat phones, and USB ports.

Every passenger in the Economy Class and the Premium Economy Class is entitled to a piece of cabin baggage, with a maximum weight of 7 kg and size of 115 cm. Meanwhile, Business Class, First Class, and Suites passengers are allowed to bring two cabin baggage, each weighing 7 kg and measuring 115 cm at most. Each passenger is also allowed a checked baggage of 30 kg for Economy Class, 35 kg for Premium Economy Class, 40 kg for Business Class, 45 kg for First Class, and 50 kg for Suites.

Singapore Airlines passengers flying on domestic flights must check-in at the latest 40 minutes before boarding, while passengers flying on international flights must check-in 90 minutes before departure at the latest. Check-in can be done online or via mobile check-in, at the check-in counters at the airport, or via the check-in kiosk at the airports in several countries.


Singapore Airlines History


Singapore Airlines began its journey on 1 May 1947 by being a part of the collaboration of Malayan Airways Limited (MAL), Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool, The Straits Steamship Company of Singapore, and Imperial Airways. The first flight it performed was a charter flight, using Airspeed Consul Aircraft, from the British Straits Settlement of Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.

The airline continued to grow between the 1940s and the 1950s. In 1955, Malayan Airways’ fleet grew with the addition of Douglas DC-3, which operated until years later. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, Vickers Viscount, Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation, Bristol Britannia, de Havilland Comet 4, and Fokker F27.

In 1963, when Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak established the Federation of Malaysia, Malayan Airways was renamed into Malaysian Airways, which would then take over Borneo Airways. After the separation of Singapore in 1966, Malaysian Airways was renamed again into Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). Seeing the rapid expansion, in 1967 MSA purchased its first Boeing 707 aircraft, followed by the inauguration of a new headquarter in Singapore and a purchase of its first Boeing 737 aircraft.

However, because of a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore in 1972, MSA ceased its operations. While Singapore wanted to develop MSA’s international routes, Malaysia wanted to focus first on the domestic routes. The disagreement resulted in the disbandment of MSA and the formation of Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System. Singapore Airlines then bought all of MSA’s Boeing 707 and 737 and retained its international routes.

Singapore Airlines grew remarkably since its separation from MSA. Its business expansion included new destination routes in Asia, as well as addition of Boeing 727, Boeing 747, and Douglas DC-10 into their fleet. Two Boeing 747s that arrived in 1973 operated the Singapore-Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo routes, while the Boeing 747-200 traveled to London, Paris, Rome, Australia, and the United States.

In 1977, Singapore Airlines operated its first delivery service with Boeing 727-200 from Singapore to Manila. In the same year, Singapore Airlines shared a Concorde with British Airways to serve a flight from London to Paya Lebar Airport in Singapore via Bahrain.  Unfortunately, the route was removed in 1980.

In 1980, the airline served new routes to destinations within the United States, Canada, and other cities in Europe, with Madrid becoming the first Spanish city served by Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines then continued to expand its fleet, with the purchase of “Big Tops” Boeing 737-400. This fleet served all Trans-Pacific routes, as well as the airline’s main destinations in Europe.

Another of Singapore Airlines’ milestone achievements was its launch of the private satellite phone that allowed passengers to make calls while flying. Then in 1993, the wax figure of Singapore Girl—created after the image of a Singapore Airlines’ flight attendant—was displayed in the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in London, as a form of award. In 2004, the Singapore Girl won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Tourism Award at the 18th Singapore Tourism Board’s Tourism Award.

In 2000, Singapore Airlines teamed up with eight chefs from all around the world to establish the International Culinary Panel to provide guests with world-class meals during the flight. Later in 2010,  Singapore Airlines published Above and Beyond: A Collection of Recipes from the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel, a cookbook that contained 50 recipes from the airline’s chefs. The cookbook was displayed and can be purchased exclusively in Business Class, First Class, and Suites.

In 2003, Singapore Airlines got five Airbus A340-500s, whose seats it converted from 64 Business Class seats and 117 Premium Economy Class seats to 100 Business Class seats to serve the route to Newark and Los Angeles. The Singapore-Newark and Los Angeles route was the two longest non-stop flights in aviation history. The Trans-Pacific nonstop flight from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles became the first non-stop flight service between Singapore and the United States. It was the longest commercial flight with 18 hours of flight time. 

In 2005, Singapore Airlines officially became the first airline using Airbus 380 in its fleet. It introduced the slogan "First to Fly the A380 – Experience the Difference in 2006" to promote the launch. In 2007, the initial flight service of the Airbus A380 aircraft flew to Sydney from Singapore with 455 passengers. Since then, the Airbus A380 has served long-route destinations like London, Mumbai, Beijing, Paris, and others.

It has been reported that Singapore Airlines would reduce the number of their aircraft in 2009 as an effort to anticipate the decrease in the number of passengers and the increase in cargo demand. However, on the contrary, the company never stopped earning great achievements. One of the Singapore Airlines’ notable achievements was made in 2012, when the airline successfully delivered a pair of pandas from Chengdu, China on a 4.5-hour of flight using the Boeing 747-400 cargo plane.

After 40 years of service, Singapore Airlines gradually laid off the Boeing 747 aircraft from its fleet in 2012. The aircraft’s last flight was between Singapore and Hong Kong, and featured special in-flight services. The airlines also announced it would end the Singapore-Newark and the Singapore-Los Angeles routes in October and November 2013. The route service to Los Angeles would still be available from Singapore, but it would be via the Narita International Airport in Tokyo.

The Singapore Airlines Group continues to expand its business by establishing several subsidiaries. SIA Engineering Company handles a repair and maintenance business in nine countries with 27 joint ventures; Singapore Airlines Cargo operates the airline’s cargo service; and there are three other subsidiaries, which include SilkAir, Scoot, and Tigerair.

During its 76 years of operation, Singapore Airlines has earned numerous international awards. In 2017, Singapore Airlines was ranked 33rd on Fortune Magazine’s Best Admired Company in the World. It was also ranked as Best Flight for Economy Class, Business Class, and First Class. Meanwhile, DestinAsian Magazine named KrisFlyer as passengers’ favorite frequent flyer program and Krisworld, Best In-flight Entertainment System.
