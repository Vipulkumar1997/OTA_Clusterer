Before moving to the Airline House office in Singapore, SilkAir’s head office was located on the fifth story of SIA Superhub. The airline began to hire male flight attendants in 2015. By the end of 2016, it had employed 1,575 staff. 

All SilkAir facilities and services are designed to ensure passengers’ comfort prior to and during their flights. The airline offers economy and business classes, each designed to fulfill the needs of its passengers.

SilkAir History


Before earning the name and reputation as Best Regional Airline, SilkAir did not start off as a regional airline. Established in 1975, SilkAir was an air-charter company known as Tradewinds Charters. In its first years, SilkAir used planes which it leased from its parent airline, Singapore Airlines.

In 1980s, Tradewinds expanded its business by serving leisure destinations and selling SIA Holiday Package using aircraft from Singapore Airlines. On 21 February 1989, Tradewinds Airlines began its operations to holiday destinations using McDonnell Douglas MD-87 plane. At this time, passengers could fly to Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai in Thailand and Kuantan in Malaysia from Singapore’s Changi Airport, and reach Tioman Island from Singapore’s first international airport, Seletar.

The company had since matured and opened more routes to Jakarta, Yangon and Phnom Penh to cater to both business and leisure travelers. Still using the same aircraft, the airline managed to provide a better experience with greater comfort.

The Tradewinds Company underwent a major overhaul in 1991, when the company changed its name to SilkAir. It introduced a new business logo, which it has used until today, and began showing its position among airline competitors. SilkAir had operated Airbus A310-200s from 1993 to 1995 before they were transferred to Singapore Airlines.

The operation of Airbus A310-200s marked SilkAir's expansion to broader routes which included India and China. The airline also became the first airline in history to provide a video-on-demand (VOD) service via the DigEplayer 5500. The service was available on flights to India and China.

In 1994, SilkAir renewed its flight attendant uniform. Replacing the seagull-motif dress designed by homegrown designer Celia Loe was a two-piece Balenciaga attire featuring a floral blouse, a blue skirt and a fitted jacket. The new look aimed to make the crew look more professional as the airline expanded to the global market.

In 1997, SilkAir bought its first Boeing, which was operated for only one year. In 1998, SilkAir operated Airbus A320-200 for its major routes. To sustain its performance, the company then purchased a smaller Airbus A319-100 in 1999. The plane flew on Southeast Asia routes and to some destinations in India. The airline kept adding new aircraft between 2009 and 2012, when it purchased 11 Airbus A320-200. In August 2012, the airline signed a letter of intent to buy 23 Boeing 737-800s, 31 Boeing 737 MAX 8, and 14 other aircraft of a different model. Until January 2017, SilkAir had operated a total of 31 aircrafts.

After more than 10 years of wearing the same uniform, SilkAir finally made a change on 15 April 2015. This time, SilkAir collaborated with Alexandria Chen, a Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) alumna, to create a more fashionable, elegant look. She added a modern touch by adding a waistline to create the illusion of a two-piece outfit and an asymmetrical neck with pleated bow on the right shoulder complete with a seagull patterned georgette bow pin. The uniform cut was intentionally designed to provide the crew with freedom of movement when tending to passengers’ needs during the journey. 

Former SilkAir CEO Leslie Thng stated that flight crew are ambassadors of an airline, hence it is important that their uniform distinguishes the airline from other competitors. The uniform represents the airline’s evolved brand which blends style and decency with a pinch of modernity relevant to changing time.

In 2016, SilkAir continued its evolution by launching an online application that simplifies passengers’ booking and boarding process. The application was created in collaboration with MTT, a leading digital travel company, to give passengers several advantages by making their booking, itinerary and flight information accessible anytime and anywhere. The app allows passengers to check their miles, acts as a check-in reminder, and even provides a Mobile Boarding Pass feature for those traveling from Changi International Airport in Singapore.
