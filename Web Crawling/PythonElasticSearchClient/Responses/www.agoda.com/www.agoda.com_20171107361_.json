This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.\n\nExcept as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.\n\nFor transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                                    <li class=\"question-default text-left\">\r\n                                        <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-question ficon-18\"></i> \r\n                                        <a class=\"question-trigger\"  data-selected=\"false\">Why is there more than one rate for the same room type?</a>\r\n\r\n                                        <div class=\"answer show-more-component\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-answer ficon-18\"></i>\r\n                                            <p>Different rates are due to the different promotions being offered by a hotel at any given time.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                                    <li class=\"question-default text-left\">\r\n                                        <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-question ficon-18\"></i> \r\n                                        <a class=\"question-trigger\"  data-selected=\"false\">How do I know if a discount has been given?</a>\r\n\r\n                                        <div class=\"answer show-more-component\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-answer ficon-18\"></i>\r\n                                            <p>All promotional rates displayed are already discounted.

The actual charge date will be approximately 2-3 days prior to the hotel booking conditions becoming active.  At that time you will be charged the full amount.  This option is only available for Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and JCB. Please make sure you select \"Pay Later\" when you input your credit card details.\n<br/><br/>\n3) <strong>Special Rates - Pay at the hotel: </strong>Agoda.com works in partnership with other companies to ensure we offer the best rates. If you choose to stay at a hotel where an agoda.com partner has provided the lowest rate, we will confirm your reservation and issue a confirmation email. In such cases we will not charge your card. You will be required to pay the hotel directly upon check-out and the hotels own cancellation policy will apply. The title of the rate section for these hotels is &#39;Special Rates&#39; instead of &#39;Rate per room per night&#39;.<br/><br/>\n Please note: Some hotels may charge your credit card with the full amount upon confirmation. This is mostly the case for non refundable bookings.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                                    <li class=\"question-default text-left\">\r\n                                        <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-question ficon-18\"></i> \r\n                                        <a class=\"question-trigger\"  data-selected=\"false\">What are the charges for taxes &amp; services?</a>\r\n\r\n                                        <div class=\"answer show-more-component\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-answer ficon-18\"></i>\r\n                                            <p>In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the charge to your credit card will include a charge for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.\n\nExcept as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.\n\nFor transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </section>\r\n                        <section data-selenium=\"content-faqs\">\r\n                            <div class=\"header-category-default category-trigger\">\r\n                                <i id=\"plus\" class=\"ficon ficon-plus-with-circle ficon-24\"></i>\r\n                                <i id=\"minus\" class=\"ficon ficon-minus-with-circle ficon-24\"></i>\r\n                                <h3>Check booking status</h3>\r\n                            </div>\r\n\r\n                            <ul class=\"question-list\">\r\n                                    <li class=\"question-default text-left\">\r\n                                        <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-question ficon-18\"></i> \r\n                                        <a class=\"question-trigger\"  data-selected=\"false\">When do I get a confirmation email?</a>\r\n\r\n                                        <div class=\"answer show-more-component\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-answer ficon-18\"></i>\r\n                                            <p>In most cases, you will receive this email along with the booking voucher (PDF file) within 30 minutes of you making the booking.

This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.\n\nExcept as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.\n\nFor transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </li>\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </section>\r\n                        <section data-selenium=\"content-faqs\">\r\n                            <div class=\"header-category-default category-trigger\">\r\n                                <i id=\"plus\" class=\"ficon ficon-plus-with-circle ficon-24\"></i>\r\n                                <i id=\"minus\" class=\"ficon ficon-minus-with-circle ficon-24\"></i>\r\n                                <h3>Writing reviews</h3>\r\n                            </div>\r\n\r\n                            <ul class=\"question-list\">\r\n                                    <li class=\"question-default text-left\">\r\n                                        <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-question ficon-18\"></i> \r\n                                        <a class=\"question-trigger\"  data-selected=\"false\">How can I review a hotel?</a>\r\n\r\n                                        <div class=\"answer show-more-component\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"ficon ficon-noti-balloon-answer ficon-18\"></i>\r\n                                            <p>In order to ensure that all reviews are legitimate, only customers with a valid completed booking are allowed to submit a hotel review.

To save you time, we've put answers to the most common inquiries here. Just click on the category and look for your question. Making a new booking Are the room rates inclusive of tax and service charge? The default setting for Agoda's price display does not include tax and service charges. To see room rates with tax and service charges included, you may select \u2018Total price per night\u2019 under Price display in the currency tab at the top of the screen. Depending on your selected settings under the currency tab, displayed room rates will note if the price listed does or does not include tax or service charges. You may also view the total price for a stay by continuing to the booking form. What are the charges for taxes & services? In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the charge to your credit card will include a charge for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain. Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location. For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services. Why is there more than one rate for the same room type? Different rates are due to the different promotions being offered by a hotel at any given time. How do I know if a discount has been given? All promotional rates displayed are already discounted. Information regarding specific hotel promotions are also displayed on the booking form. For more details, please continue to the booking form. What does Hot Deal, Non-refundable, Special conditions, etc stated next to my room type mean? Hot Deal, Non-refundable, Special conditions, etc is an indication of a special promotion with some form of discount for a particular hotel, room type or period of stay. Bookings under promotion usually have a very strict cancellation policy which often results in a full period charge. Please make sure to read the booking conditions carefully before you submit your reservation. Are the room rates per person or per room? The rates displayed are per room, NOT per person. It is important that you input the correct number of guests associated with this booking as rates may change based on occupancy. In some instances, a hotel limits the number of guests per room. To avoid additional charges when you check in, the number of guests must be accurate. Can Agoda recommend a hotel for my stay? While Agoda cannot provide specific travel advice, we do provide verified reviews from real travelers, as well as complete information regarding facilities, locations, and star ratings. By default, your search results will be sorted based our recommendations for the best value and most reliable partner properties. Can I add an extra bed/baby cot in my room? Most hotels allow children to stay in the room with parents either with or without an extra bed. The normal hotel policy is not to charge for children if they are under twelve years of age. Some hotels will limit occupancy of a room to two adults and one child. Only a few hotels will have existing bedding for additional children, so an extra bed is usually required. Most hotels will charge for this extra bed. Usually hotels will provide breakfast when there is a charge for an extra bed. However, this is dependent on each property's policies and procedures. A baby cot may be provided free of charge, by some hotels, for children under the age of 2. Can I book a room type that is not listed with Agoda? No. Only those room types available will be displayed after you enter your travel requirements. Can I make a booking for a check in date of today on the Agoda website? Yes, this is possible as long as the room is available on the Agoda website when you make a search. Can I make a reservation directly through the hotel? Of course you can; however, Agoda often offers prices that are 10%-30% lower than many hotel's direct booking prices. Additionally, we offer benefits like Pay Later, Free Cancellation, and Low Price Guarantee that you won't get by booking directly. Can I remove the transfer service if I don\u2019t want it? When a transfer service is listed, it's usually a requirement in order to get to your hotel of choice. You can choose not to use the service but hotels will be reluctant to remove the fee. You will need to negotiate with the hotel upon arrival. Do you offer special discounts for senior citizens, airline employees, hotel member cards or Government officials? No further discounts are available unless noted on the hotel page. How can I check for budget hotels? After inputting your destination and travel dates into the search box, you will be redirected to the search results page. Here, you can sort the results based on price, star rating, or special deals. You may also filter your search results by price range, preferred star rating, or accommodation type to find budget accommodation. How can I check the rates on your website? Please note that room rates and availability are subject to change at any time. Agoda cannot provide you with a quoted rate because of this variation. You can get the most up-to-date rates and availability by going to the website and completing your travel information. How can I get 1 night free when booking a room with \"Rates includes discount worth 1 night\" promotion? All promotional rates displayed are already discounted. If free nights are included in the booking, you will receive a discount worth the specified amount of nights. You will not get more free nights in addition to what you book on the website. Information regarding specific hotel promotions are also displayed on the booking form. For more details, please continue to the booking form. How can I see the room rate in a currency of my choice? You can easily choose the currency of your choice by selecting it from the drop-down box found at the top of the page. The page will automatically update to reflect the selected currency. How do I make a booking? Please note that room rates and availability are subject to change at any time. Agoda cannot provide you with a quoted rate because of this variation. You can get the most up-to-date rates and availability by going to the website and completing your travel information. IMPORTANT: Please note that the lead guest name is entered correctly. How long does it take to check if a room is available? Availability is based on your search criteria. If a hotel is displayed based on your search criteria, the available room types will be displayed. How many rooms are available? The number of rooms available for your period of stay is displayed on the hotel page after you enter in your travel requirements (dates & destination). If you wish to book more rooms than what are available, you will need to split into different room types or search for another hotel. Please note that we may not be able to confirm room availability for any additional rooms in any extra booking, as rooms can be taken at any time. I have made a booking on the Agoda website but I have found a cheaper rate. Agoda offers the following \u201cBest Price Guarantee\u201d. If you have reserved a hotel room through Agoda and then show us that you could book the same room for the same dates with the same conditions at a lower rate that is viewable and bookable on another website. We will either match that rate or beat it. Please click on the following link for further information : http://www.agoda.com/info/agoda_policies.html#1 Is there an additional charge for children when sharing a room with their parents? Most hotels allow children to stay in the room with parents either with or without an extra bed. The normal hotel policy is not to charge for children if they are under twelve years of age. Some hotels will limit occupancy of a room to two adults and one child. Only a few hotels will have existing bedding for additional children, so an extra bed is usually required. Most hotels will charge for this extra bed. Usually hotels will provide breakfast when there is a charge for an extra bed. However, this is dependent on each property's policies and procedures. A baby cot may be provided free of charge, by some hotels, for children under the age of 2. l want to stay longer than 30 days/nights If you require more than a 30-day stay, you need to make 2 separate bookings. For example, a 35 night stay would need to be broken out into 2 bookings, 1 for 30 days, the other for 5 days. Travel Advisories and Other News Events happen around the world and, occasionally, your travel destination may be affected by an unexpected occurrence. In addition, you should familiarize yourself with the country you are planning to visit, both in terms of customs and habits, but also about potential risks.

Please note that rooms are subject to availability, and that some properties may have different policies or conditions that apply to bookings of 5 rooms or more.

The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs.

This dubious business practice is unfortunately completely out of our control.

Problem with Tax and Service Charges In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the charge to your credit card will include a charge for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain. Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location. For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees may include a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
